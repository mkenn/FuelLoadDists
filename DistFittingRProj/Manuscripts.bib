abstract = {The major objective of the research reported in this paper was to perform a pilot study for mapping fire fuel properties of southern Californian chaparral shrubs and associated forest ecotones using multi-date (seasonal) Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image data. Information on past, current and future (predicted) distributions of vegetation properties pertaining to fire fuels are necessary for understanding, monitoring, managing and modeling fire in changing Mediterranean landscapes. Seasonal and interannual variability of some vegetation properties can be extracted from multi-date remotely sensed data that may provide useful information pertaining to fire fuel distributions. Brightness (BR), Greenness (GR) and Wetness (WT) transform images were derived from two geometrically and radiometrically registered TM images acquired in San Diego Country. California, USA, near the beginning and end of the 1986-1987 growing season. Seasonal difference images of these transforms were also generated. Transform and difference values were stratified by vegetation community type and stand age or slope aspect, using an existing raster geographic information system database. The BR and GR images provided unique spatial information pertaining to vegetation conditions. Seasonal change in BR was highest for burn and meadow areas, while high values in seasonal change in GR corresponded to deciduous oak woodlands, grasslands and vegetated north facing slopes. End-of-season GR for Mixed Chaparral varied with stand age in a manner which was similar to field measurements of total and live standing biomass. Differential illumination effects seem to dominate spatial variations in BR and GR values and their seasonal change as a function of slope aspect.},
annote = {This is a study that Kate Brandis and Carol Jacobson used to provide some information in their introduction. This is the plot study for fire fuel properties in Southern California chaparral forests. They state that chaparral forests have high recurrence intervals for fires and fires burn extremely hot. These pose severe threats to the communities around these forests. The study examined information content of Landsat data. Stow et al suggest that the need for this data is vital because the changing atmosphere and climate could cause changes in fire regimes.},

abstract = {Wildland fuel characteristics are used in many applications of operational fire predictions and to understand fire effects and behaviour. Even so, there is a shortage of information on basic fuel properties and the physical characteristics of wildland fuels. The Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS) builds and catalogues fuelbed descriptions based on realistic physical properties derived from direct or indirect observation, inventories, expert knowledge, inference, or simulated fuel characteristics. The FCCS summarizes and calculates wildland fuel characteristics, including fuel depth, loading, and surface area. Users may modify fuelbeds and thereby capture changing fuel conditions over time and (or) under different management prescriptions. Fuel loadings from four sample fuelbed pairs (i.e., pre- and post-prescribed fire) were calculated and compared by using FCCS to demonstrate the versatility of the system and how individual fuel components, such as shrubs, nonwoody fuels, woody fuels, and litter, can be calculated and summarized. The ability of FCCS to catalogue and summarize complex fuelbeds and reflect dynamic fuel conditions allows calculated results to be used in a variety of applications including surface and crown fire predictions, carbon assessments, and wildlife habitat management.},

abstract = {The overall effects of the fire on ecosystems are complex, ranging from the reduction or elimination of aboveground biomass to impacts on belowground physical, chemical and microbial mediated processes. Since a key component of overall ecosystem sustainability occurs belowground, recovery is tied to the soil's physical, chemical, and biological functions and processes. Depending on several fire severity measures, changes in belowground components can be either beneficial or deleterious to the entire ecosystem. Low-impact burning can promote a herbaceous flora, increase plant available nutrients, and thin overcrowded forests, all of which can foster healthy systems. Severe fires can often cause changes in successional rates, alter above- and belowground species composition, generate volatilization of nutrients and ash entrainment in smoke columns produce rapid or decreased mineralization rates, alter C:N ratios, and result in subsequent nutrient losses through accelerated erosion, leaching or denitrification. In addition, changes in soil hydrologic functioning, degradation of soil physical properties, decreases in micro- and macrofauna, and alterations in microbial populations and associated processes can occur. The direct effect of fire on belowground systems, is a result of the burning severity, which integrates aboveground fuel loading (live and dead), soil moisture and subsequent soil temperatures, and duration of the burn. The time for recovery of belowground systems will not only depend on the burning intensity and its effect on key ecosystem processes and components, but also on the previous land-use practices. Thus, the impacts of fire on belowground systems can be highly variable and may not be predictable. Our paper is a general review of the effects of fire on belowground systems with emphasis placed on the changes in physical, biogeochemical and biological properties of soils and the resulting consequences these changes have for ecosystem sustainability.},

abstract = {We present an overview of the Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS), a tool that enables land managers, regulators, and scientists to create and catalogue fuelbeds and to classify those fuelbeds for their capacity to support fire and consume fuels. The fuelbed characteristics and fire classification from this tool will provide inputs for current and future sophisticated models for the quantification of fire behavior, fire effects, and carbon accounting and enable assessment of fuel treatment effectiveness. The system was designed from requirements provided by land managers, scientists, and policy makers gathered through six regional workshops. The FCCS contains a set of fuelbeds representing the United States, which were compiled from scientific literature, fuels photo series, fuels data sets, and expert opinion. The system enables modification and enhancement of these fuelbeds to represent a particular scale of interest. The FCCS then reports assigned and calculated fuel characteristics for each existing fuelbed stratum including the canopy, shrubs, nonwoody, woody, litter–lichen–moss, and duff. Finally, the system classifies each fuelbed by calculating fire potentials that provide an index of the intrinsic capacity of each fuelbed to support surface fire behavior, support crown fire, and provide fuels for flaming, smoldering, and residual consumption. The FCCS outputs are being used in a national wildland fire emissions inventory and in the development of fuelbed, fire hazard, and treatment effectiveness maps on several national forests. Although the FCCS was built for the United States, the conceptual framework is applicable worldwide.},

abstract = {Wildfires are a serious problem affecting many terrestrial ecosystems and causing substantial economic damage. Understanding the variation in structure of fuels (which is predominantly represented by plant litter and live vegetation) is key to understanding the behaviour of wildland fires. An understanding of changes to fuels as vegetation develops is also central to the management of both wildfire and the planning of prescribed burning. A description of fuel structure is required for all models of fire behaviour. It is therefore important that we have an appropriate system for describing fuel structure and predicting how fuel structure will develop through time (i.e. fuel succession). In this paper we review the range of published models used for fuel description and fuel succession. We propose an object-orientated database as an appropriate method for storing the complex data structures that are needed to process and analyse data on fuels. The potential advantages of an object-orientated database as a tool for modelling fuel succession are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Wildland fuelbeds are exceptionally complex, consisting of diverse particles of many sizes, types and shapes with abundances and properties that are highly variable in time and space. This complexity makes it difficult to accurately describe, classify, sample and map fuels for wildland fire research and management. As a result, many fire behaviour and effects software prediction systems use a generalised description of fuels to simplify data collection and entry into various computer programs. There are several major fuel description systems currently used in the United States, Canada and Australia, and this is a source of confusion for many in fire management. This paper (1) summarises the challenges of describing fuels, (2) contrasts approaches (association, classification and abstraction) for developing fuel description systems and (3) discusses possible future directions in wildland fuel description and science to transition to a universal fuel description system. Most discussion centres on surface fuel loadings as the primary descriptive characteristic. This synthesis paper is intended to provide background for understanding surface fuel classification and description systems and their use in simulating fire behaviour and effects, quantifying carbon inventories and evaluating site productivity.},

abstract = {Fuel loads in forest areas are dependent on vegetation type and the time since the last fire. This paper reports a study on the feasibility of using remotely sensed data to estimate vegetative fuel loads. It describes two methods for estimating fuel loads using Landsat TM data based on equations describing litter accumulation and decomposition. The first method uses classification techniques to predict vegetation types coupled with fire history data to derive current fuel loads. The second method applies a canopy turnover rate to estimate litterfall and subsequently accumulated litter from biomass, thus utilising the dominant influence of canopy on remotely sensed data. Both methods are compared with data collected from Popran National Park in coastal New South Wales. The amounts of litter calculated with the biomass method were similar to field results, but the classification method was found to overestimate fuel loads. A sensitivity analysis investigated the impact of varying the vegetation constants and rates used in the fuel estimates to simulate uncertainty or error in their values. The biomass method was less subject to uncertainties and has potential for estimating fuel quantities to provide useful spatial information for fire managers.},

This study also refers to a study about the feasibility of remote sensing to estimate fuel loads. One of Brandis and Jacobson's conclusions were that if fire history data is present it is possible to estimate fuel loads from remotely sensed data. Using Conroy's equation in predicting biomass turnover, the fuel quantities were closer to the actual quantities. They concluded that this would have potential to measure loads in remote and rugged locations. Accuracy of fuel load estimates would be improved if there were better estimates of vegetation data. Remote sensing has advantages over the current methods like; time in the field would be reduced, data for remote areas could be obtained, and imagery could provide a range of other related information.},

abstract = {The Coarse Woody Debris (CWD) quantity, defined as biomass per unit area (t/ha), and the quality, defined as the proportion of standing dead logs to the total CWD quantity, greatly contribute to many ecological processes such as forest nutrient cycling, tree regeneration, wildlife habitat, fire dynamics, and carbon dynamics. However, a cost-effective and time-saving method to determine CWD is not available. Very limited literature could be found that applies remote sensing technique to CWD inventory. In this paper, we fused the wall-to-wall multi-frequency and multi-polarization Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AirSAR) and optical Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) to estimate the quantity and quality of CWD in Yellowstone post-fire forest ecosystem, where the severe 1988 fire event resulted in high spatial heterogeneity of dead logs. To relate backscatter values to CWD metrics, we first reduced the terrain effect to remove the interference of topography on AirSAR backscatter. Secondly, we removed the influence of regenerating sapling by quadratic polynomial fitting between AVIRIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and different channels backscatters. The quantity of CWD was derived from Phh and Phv, and the quality of CWD was derived from Phh aided by the ratio of Lhv and Phh. Two maps of Yellowstone post-fire CWD quantity and quality were produced. The calculated CWD quantity and quality were validated by extensive field surveys. Regarding CWD quantity, the correlation coefficient between measured and predicted CWD is only 0.54 with mean absolute error up to 29.1 t/ha. However, if the CWD quantity was discretely classified into three categories of "≤ 60", "60-120", and "≥ 120", the overall accuracy is 65.6{\{}{\%}{\}}; if classified into two categories of "≤ 90" and "≥ 90", the overall accuracy is 73.1{\{}{\%}{\}}; if classified into two categories of "≤ 60" and "≥ 60", the overall accuracy is 84.9{\{}{\%}{\}}. This indicates our attempt to map CWD quantity spatially and continuously achieved partial success; however, the general and discrete categories are reasonable. Regarding CWD quality, the overall accuracy of 5 types (Type 1-standing CWD ratio ≥ 40{\{}{\%}{\}}; Type 2-15{\{}{\%}{\}} ≤ standing CWD ratio {\{}{\textless}{\}} 40{\{}{\%}{\}}; Type 3-7{\{}{\%}{\}} ≤ standing CWD ratio{\{}{\textless}{\}} 15{\{}{\%}{\}}; Type 4-3{\{}{\%}{\}} ≤ standing CWD ratio {\{}{\textless}{\}} 7{\{}{\%}{\}}; Type 5-standing CWD ratio {\{}{\textless}{\}} 3{\{}{\%}{\}}) is only 40.32{\{}{\%}{\}}. However, when type 1, 2, 3 are combined into one category and type 4 and 5 are combined into one category, the overall accuracy is 67.74{\{}{\%}{\}}. This indicates the partial success of our initial results to map CWD quality into detailed categories, but the result is acceptable if solely very coarse CWD quality is considered. Bias can be attributed to the complex influence of many factors, such as field survey error, sapling compensation, terrain effect reduction, surface properties, and backscatter mechanism understanding. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The inventory and monitoring of coarse woody debris (CWD) carbon (C) stocks is an essential component of any comprehensive National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NGHGI). Due to the expense and difficulty associated with conducting field inventories of CWD pools, CWD C stocks are often modeled as a function of more commonly measured stand attributes such as live tree C density. In order to assess potential benefits of adopting a field-based inventory of CWD C stocks in lieu of the current model-based approach, a national inventory of downed dead wood C across the U.S. was compared to estimates calculated from models associated with the U.S.'s NGHGI and used in the USDA Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis program. The model-based population estimate of C stocks for CWD (i.e., pieces and slash piles) in the conterminous U.S. was 9 percent (145.1 Tg) greater than the field-based estimate. The relatively small absolute difference was driven by contrasting results for each CWD component. The model-based population estimate of C stocks from CWD pieces was 17 percent (230.3 Tg) greater than the field-based estimate, while the model-based estimate of C stocks from CWD slash piles was 27 percent (85.2 Tg) smaller than the field-based estimate. In general, models overestimated the C density per-unit-area from slash piles early in stand development and underestimated the C density from CWD pieces in young stands. This resulted in significant differences in CWD C stocks by region and ownership. The disparity in estimates across spatial scales illustrates the complexity in estimating CWD C in a NGHGI. Based on the results of this study, it is suggested that the U.S. adopt field-based estimates of CWD C stocks as a component of its NGHGI to both reduce the uncertainty within the inventory and improve the sensitivity to potential management and climate change events.},

Many factors complicate the relationship between live and dead carbon wood stocks. The models in this study may provide plausible coarse woody debris carbon population at the national scale but does introduce some bias into the model. The models will always predict coarse woody debris carbon stocks wherever the live tree carbon stocks are well understood. However, the models greatly underestimate the coarse woody debris carbon stocks when morality events result in low live carbon stocks.

abstract = {1. Coarse woody debris (CWD) is an important component of temperate stream and forest ecosystems. We have reviewed the rates at which CWD is added and removed from ecosystems, the biomass found in streams and forests, and many functions that CWD serves. 2. CWD is added to ecosystems by numerous mechanisms, including wind, fire, insect attack, pathogens, competition, and geomorphic processes. Despite the many long-term studies on tree mortality, there are few published rates of CWD input on mass-area-1 time-1 basis. Most ecological studies have not measured CWD input over a long enough period or a large enough area to give accurate estimates. Input rates measured in temperate ecosystems range from 0.12 to 14.9 Mg ha-1 year-1 and vary greatly over time and space. 3. Once CWD enters the detrital food web, it is decomposed by a large array of organisms and physical processes. Although respiration-caused losses have been the focus of many studies, CWD is also significantly transformed physically and chemically. Movement of CWD, especially in streams, is also an important but poorly documented mechanism whereby CWD is lost from ecosystems. Many factors control the rate at which CWD decomposes, including temperature, moisture, the internal gas composition of CWD, substrate quality, the size of the CWD, and the types of organisms involved. However, the importance of many of these factors has yet to be established in field experiments. 4. The mass of CWD in an ecosystem ideally represents the balance between addition and loss. In reality, slow decomposition rates and erratic variations in input of CWD cause the CWD mass to deviate markedly from steady-state projections. The mass of CWD in stream and forest ecosystems varies widely, ranging between 1 and 269 Mg ha-1. Many differences correspond to forest type, with deciduous-dominated systems having generally lower biomass than conifer-dominated systems. However, conifer-dominated systems with low productivity also have low CWD mass. Stream size also influences CWD mass in lotic ecosystems, while successional stage dramatically influences CWD mass in boat aquatic and terrestrial settings. 5. CWD performs many functions in ecosystems, serving as auto-trophic and heterotrophic habitat and strongly influencing geomorphic processes, especially in streams. It is also a major component of nutrient cycles in many ecosystems. We have reviewed these many functions and conclude that CWD is an important functional component of stream and forest ecosystems. 6. Humans have greatly affected the amount of CWD found in temperate ecosystems by removing CWD and by changing the rate of input and the rate and pattern of loss. In some cases, human influences have been so pervasive that natural conditions are difficult to define. Management practices concerning CWD often have not been based on the numerous beneficial roles this material plays in ecosystems. Better scientific understanding of these functions and the natural factors influencing CWD dynamics should lead to more enlightened management practices.

Fuelbeds are considered relatively homogeneous units on the landscape, representing distinct combustion environments that determine potential fire behaviour and effects.

Fuelbeds are described by several qualitative and quantitative physical and biological variables with emphasis on characteristics useful for fuels management and fire behaviour planning. The FCCS includes 216 fuelbeds that represent the major vegetation types of the United States. The FCCS fuelbeds can be used as presented or modified to create customized fuelbeds with general or site-specific data to address fire science management or research questions.

The approach, that they state, has been used to map vegetation and they say that this could be used as a method to map fuel types.

abstract = {Wildland fuels are important to fire managers because they can be manipulated to achieve management goals, such as restoring ecosystems, decreasing fire intensity, minimizing plant mortality, and reducing erosion. However, it is difficult to accurately measure, describe, and map wildland fuels because of the great variability of wildland fuelbed properties over space and time. Few have quantified the scale of this variability across space to understand its effect on fire spread, burning intensity, and ecological effects. This study investigated the spatial variability of loading (biomass) across major surface and canopy fuel components in low elevation northern Rocky Mountain forest and rangeland ecosystems to determine the inherent scale of surface fuel and canopy fuel distributions. Biomass loadings (kg m super(-2)) were measured for seven surface fuel components-four downed dead woody fuel size classes (0-6 mm, 6-25 mm, 25-75 mm, and 75 + mm), duff plus litter, shrub, and herb-using a spatially nested plot sampling design within a 1 km super(2) square sampling grid installed at six sites in the northern US Rocky Mountains. Bulk density, biomass, and cover of the forest canopy were also measured for each plot in the grid. Surface fuel loadings were estimated using a combination of photoload and destructive collection methods at many distances within the grid. We quantified spatial variability of fuel component loading using spatial variograms, and found that each fuel component had its own inherent scale with fine fuels varying at scales of 1-5 m, coarse fuels at 10-150 m, and canopy fuels from 100 to 500 m. Using regression analyses, we computed a scaling factor of 4.6 m for fuel particle diameter (4.6 m increase in scale with each cm increase in particle diameter). Findings from this study can be used to design fuel sampling projects, classify fuelbeds, and map fuel characteristics, such as loading, to account for the inherent scale of fuel distributions to get more accurate fuel loading estimations.},

abstract = {Fuel mapping is a complex and often multidisciplinary process, involving remote sensing, ground-based validation, statistical modelling, and knowledge-based systems. The scale and resolution of fuel mapping depend both on objectives and availability of spatial data layers. We demonstrate use of the Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS) for fuel mapping at two scales and resolutions: the conterminous USA (CONUS) at 1 km resolution and the Wenatchee National Forest, in Washington State, at 25 m resolution. We focus on the classification phase of mapping — assigning a unique fuelbed to each mapped cell in a spatial data layer. Using a rule-based method, we mapped 112 fuelbeds onto 7.8 million 1 km cells in the CONUS, and mapped 34 fuelbeds onto 18 million 25 m cells in the Wenatchee National Forest. These latter 34 fuelbeds will be further subdivided based on quantitative spatial data layers representing stand structure and disturbance history. The FCCS maps can be used for both modelling and management at commensurate scales. Dynamic fuel mapping is necessary as we move into the future with rapid climatic and land-use change, and possibly increasing disturbance extent and severity. The rule-based methods described here are well suited for updating with new spatial data, to keep local, regional, and continental scale fuel assessments current and inform both research and management.},

However, monitoring fire effects is often difficult because data collection requires abundant funds, resources, and sampling experience. Often, the reason fire monitoring projects are not implemented is because fire management agencies do not have scientifically based, standardized protocols for inventorying pre- and postfire conditions that satisfy their monitoring and management objectives. We have developed a comprehensive system, called the Fire Effects Monitoring and Inventory System (FIREMON), which is designed to satisfy fire management agencies' monitoring and inventory requirements for most ecosystems, fuel types, and geographic areas in the United States. FIREMON consists of standardized sampling methods and manuals, field forms, database, analysis program, and an image analysis guide so that fire managers can 1) design a fire effects monitoring project, 2) collect and store the sampled data, 3) statistically analyze and summarize the data, 4) link the data with satellite imagery, and 5) map the sampled data across the landscape using image processing. FIREMON allows flexible but comprehensive sampling of fire effects so data can be evaluated for significant impacts, shared across agencies, and used to update and refine fire management plans and prescriptions. FIREMON has a flexible structure that allows the modification of sampling methods and local code fields to allow the sampling of locally important fire effects evaluation criteria.},

abstract = {Fuel Loading Models (FLMs) and Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCSs) fuelbeds are used throughout wildland fire science and management to simplify fuel inputs into fire behavior and effects models, but they have yet to be thoroughly evaluated with field data. In this study, we used a large dataset of Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) surface fuel estimates (n=13,138) to create a new fuel classification called Fuel Type Groups (FTGs) from FIA forest type groups, and then keyed an FLM, FCCS, and FTG class to each FIA plot based on fuel loadings and stand conditions. We then compared FIA sampled loadings to the keyed class loading values for four surface fuel components (duff, litter, fine woody debris, coarse woody debris) and to mapped FLM, FCCS, and FTG class loading values from spatial fuel products. We found poor performances (R2{\textless}0.30) for most fuel component loadings in all three classifications that, in turn, contributed to poor mapping accuracies. The main reason for the poor performances is the high variability of the four fuel component loadings within classification categories and the inherent scale of this variability does not seem to match the FIA measurement scale or LANDFIRE mapping scale. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The development of a mathematical model for predicting rate of fire spread and intensity applicable to a wide range of wildland fuels is presented from the conceptual stage through evaluation and demonstration of results to hypothetical fuel models. The model was developed for and is now being used as a basis for appraising fire spread and intensity in the National FireDanger Rating System. The initial work was done using fuel arrays composed of uniform size particles. Three fuel sizes were tested over a wide range of bulk densities. These were 0.026-inch-square cut excelsior, 114-inch sticks, and 112-inch sticks. The problem of mixed fuel sizes was then resolved by weighting the various particle sizes that compose actual fuel arrays by either surface area or loading, depending upon the feature of the fire being predicted. The model is complete in the sense that no prior knowledge of a fuel's burning characteristics is required. All that is necessary are inputs describing the physical and chemical makeup of the fuel and the environmental conditions in which it is expected to burn. Inputs include fuel loading, fuel depth, fuel particle surface-area-to-volume ratio, fuel particle heat content, fuel particle moisture and mineral content, and the moisture content at which extinction can be expected. Environmental inputs are mean wind velocity and slope of terrain. For heterogeneous mixtures, the fuel properties are entered for each particle size. The model as originally conceived was for dead fuels in a uniform stratum contiguous to the ground, such as litter or grass. It has been found to be useful, however, for fuels ranging from pine needle litter to heavy logging slash and for California brush fields. The concept of fuel models is introduced, wherein parameters of wildland fuels necessary for inputs to the model are categbrized and tabulated. These are then used to predict fire spread and intensity; this eliminates the necessity for repeatedly measuring such parameters. The conceptual approach recognizes that fuels have inherent characteristics that are repeatable.},

Although one can find published errors in calculations, the majority of statistical pitfalls result from incorrect logic or interpretation despite correct numerical calculations. There are often simple solutions to avoiding these problems that require only patience, clarity of thinking, probabilistic insight, and a reduced reliance on out- of-the-box approaches. Some of these trouble spots are inherent to all statistical analyses and others are particularly insidious in ecology where true controls or replication are challenging, small sample sizes are common, and correctly linking mathematical constructs and ecological ideas is essential. Here we summarize the most common statistical pitfalls observed over nearly a century of combined consulting and research experience in ecological statistics. We provide short, simple solutions.},

abstract = {Fire-scarred trees provide a deep temporal record of historical fire activity, but identifying the mechanisms therein that controlled landscape fire patterns is not straightforward. We use a spatially correlated metric for fire co-occurrence between pairs of trees (the S{\o}rensen distance variogram), with output from a neutral model for fire history, to infer the relative strength of top-down vs. bottom-up controls on historical fire regimes. An inverse modeling procedure finds combinations of neutral-model parameters that produce S{\o}rensen distance variograms with statistical properties similar to those observed from two landscapes in eastern Washington, USA, with contrasting topography. We find the most parsimonious model structure that is able to replicate the observed patterns and the parameters of this model provide surrogates for the predominance of top-down vs. bottom-up controls. Simulations with relatively low spread probability produce irregular fire perimeters and variograms similar to those from the topographically complex landscape. With higher spread probabilities fires exhibit regular perimeters and variograms similar to those from the simpler landscape. We demonstrate that cross-scale properties of the fire-scar record, even without historical fuels and weather data, document how complex topography creates strong bottom-up controls on fire spread. This control is weaker in simpler topography, and may be compromised in a future climate with more severe weather events.},

abstract = {Neutral landscape models, derived from percolation theory in the field of landscape ecology, are grid-based maps in which complex habitat distributions are generated by random or fractal algorithms. This grid-based representation of landscape structure is compatible with the raster-based format of geographical information systems (GIS), which facilitates comparisons between theoretical and real landscapes. Neutral landscape models permit the identification of critical thresholds in connectivity, which can be used to predict when landscapes will become fragmented. The coupling of neutral landscape models with generalized population models, such as metapopulation theory, provides a null modelfor generating predictions about population dynamics in fragmented landscapes. Neutral landscape models can contribute to the following applications in conservation: (1) incorporation of complex spatial patterns in (meta)population models; (2) identification of species' perceptions of landscape structure; (3) determination of landscape connectivity; (4) evaluation of the consequences of habitatfragmentation for population subdivision; (5) identification of the domain of metapopulation dynamics; (6) prediction of the occurrence of extinction thresholds; (7) determination of the genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation; and (8) reserve design and ecosystem management. This generalized, spatially explicit framework bridges the gap between spatially implicit, patch-based models and spatially realistic GIS applications which are usually parameterized for a single species in a specific landscape. Development of a generalized, spatially explicit framework is essential in conservation biology because we will not be able to develop individual models for every species of management concern.},

abstract = {Fuel reduction treatments are increasingly used to mitigate future wildfire severity in dry forests, but few opportunities exist to assess their effectiveness. We evaluated the influence of fuel treatment, tree size and species on tree mortality following a large wildfire event in recent thin-only, thin and prescribed burn (thin-Rx) units. Of the trees that died within the first 3 years, most died in the first year regardless of treatment. First-year mortality was much higher in control and thin-only units (65 and 52{\%}) than in thin-Rx units (37{\%}). Cumulative third-year mortality followed a similar trend (78 and 64{\%} in control and thin-only units) v. 43{\%} in thin-Rx units. Percentage crown scorch is a strong predictor of mortality and is highly dependent on fuel treatment. Across all treatments, Pinus ponderosa had a lower probability of post-fire mortality than did Pseudotsuga menziesii. Finally, the probability of beetle attack on surviving trees was highest in large-diameter trees within thin-only treatments and lowest within thin-Rx treatments. This study contributes further evidence supporting the effectiveness of thinning and prescribed burning on mitigating post-fire tree mortality. We also present evidence that a combination of thinning and prescribed burning is associated with lower incidence of post-fire bark beetle attack},

abstract = {Wildfire affects the ecosystem services of watersheds, and climate change will modify fire regimes and watershed dynamics. In many eco-hydrological simulations, fire is included as an exogenous force. Rarely are the bidirectional feedbacks between watersheds and fire regimes integrated in a simulation system because the eco- hydrological model predicts variables that are incompatible with the requirements of fire models. WMFire is a fire- spread model of intermediate complexity designed to be integrated with the Regional Hydro-ecological Simulation System (RHESSys). Spread in WMFire is based on four variables that (i) represent known influences on fire spread: litter load, relative moisture deficit, wind direction and topographic slope, and (ii) are derived directly from RHESSys outputs. The probability that a fire spreads from pixel to pixel depends on these variables as predicted by RHESSys. We tested a partial integration between WMFire and RHESSys on the Santa Fe (New Mexico) and the HJ Andrews (Oregon State) watersheds. Model assessment showed correspondence between expected spatial patterns of spread and seasonality in both watersheds. These results demonstrate the efficacy of an approach to link eco-hydrologic model outputs with a fire spread model. Future work will develop a fire effects module in RHESSys for a fully coupled, bidirectional model},

Although metric development proved to be significant, the focus on metrics obscured the need for iterative hypothesis testing fundamental to the advancement of the discipline. We present here an example of an alternative neutral model and hypothesis designed to relate the process of landscape change to observed landscape patterns. The methods and program, QRULE, are described and options for statistical testing outlined. The results show that human fragmentation of landscapes results in a non-random association of land-cover types that can be describe by simple statistical methods. Options for additional landscape studies are discussed and access to QRULE described in the hope that these methods will be employed to advance our understanding of the processes that affect the structure and function in human dominated landscapes.},

abstract = {I present examples of plant functional–structural models (FSMs) that are used to evaluate how foliage units affect whole-canopy functions, and I show that multi-criteria optimization is an effective tool for these models. FSMs produce plant structures through the repeated application of a set of rules for the placement of foliage units. The models are blind (rules are the same regardless of dynamic simulation conditions), sighted (rules change with interference from other foliage units) or self-regulatory (rules change depending on the conditions of the simulation, i.e., internal conditions). In the examples presented, the models are used to optimize plant morphology for one or more measures of plant performance; these measures include movement of materials and associated hydraulic functions, foliage display, light interception and net carbon, mechanical support and stability, and reproductive success. It is consistently found that no morphology is optimal for any single measure of plant performance, and the rules for plant development are not stationary in space and time. In multi-criteria optimization, alternative morphologies are compared against multiple measures of plant performance; these are optimized simultaneously using Pareto optimality, which yields the set of mutually co-dominant solutions not dominated by any other solution. Two solutions are considered to be mutually co-dominant if improvement with respect to one criterion is at the expense of another criterion. I conclude that multi-criteria optimization is an essential tool for the use of FSMs to relate processes at the foliage level to whole-canopy function and to explain the structural diversity of old-growth forests},

abstract = {Given that resource managers rely on computer simulation models when it is difficult or expensive to obtain vital information directly, it is important to evaluate how well a particular model satisfies applications for which it is designed. The Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) is used widely for forest management in the US, and its scope and complexity continue to increase. This paper focuses on the accuracy of estimates made by the Fire and Fuels Extension (FFE-FVS) predictions through comparisons between model outputs and measured post-fire conditions for the Cold Springs wildfire and on the sensitivity of model outputs to weather, disease, and fuel inputs. For each set of projected, pre-fire stand conditions, a fire was simulated that approximated the actual conditions of the Cold Springs wildfire as recorded by local portable weather stations. We also simulated a fire using model default values. From the simulated post-fire conditions, values of tree mortality and fuel loads were obtained for comparison to post-fire, observed values. We designed eight scenarios to evaluate how model output changed with varying input values for three parameter sets of interest: fire weather, disease, and fuels. All of the tested model outputs displayed some sensitivity to alternative model inputs. Our results indicate that tree mortality and fuels were most sensitive to whether actual or default weather was used and least sensitive to whether or not disease data were included as model inputs. The performance of FFE-FVS for estimating total surface fuels was better for the scenarios using actual weather data than for the scenarios using default weather data. It was rare that the model could predict fine fuels or litter. Our results suggest that using site-specific information over model default values could significantly improve the accuracy of simulated values.},

abstract = {Background and Aims Constructing functional-structural plant models (FSPMs) is a valuable method for examining how physiology and morphology interact in determining plant processes. However, such models always have uncertainty concerned with whether model components have been selected and represented effectively, with the number of model outputs simulated and with the quality of data used in assessment. We provide a procedure for defining uncertainty of an FSPM and how this uncertainty can be reduced. Methods An important characteristic of FSPMs is that typically they calculate many variables. These can be variables that the model is designed to predict and also variables that give indications of how the model functions. Together these variables are used as criteria in a method of multi-criteria assessment. Expected ranges are defined and an evolutionary computation algorithm searches for model parameters that achieve criteria within these ranges. Typically, different combinations of model parameter values provide solutions achieving different combinations of variables within their specified ranges. We show how these solutions define a Pareto Frontier that can inform about the functioning of the model. Key Results The method of multi-criteria assessment is applied to development of BRANCHPRO, an FSPM for foliage reiteration on old-growth branches of Pseudotsuga menziesii. A geometric model utilizing probabilities for bud growth is developed into a causal explanation for the pattern of reiteration found on these branches and how this pattern may contribute to the longevity of this species. Conclusions FSPMs should be assessed by their ability to simulate multiple criteria simultaneously. When different combinations of parameter values achieve different groups of assessment criteria effectively a Pareto Frontier can be calculated and used to define the sources of model uncertainty.},

abstract = {We discuss a method for analyzing data that are positively skewed and contain a substantial proportion of zeros. Such data commonly arise in ecological applications, when the focus is on the abundance of a species. The form of the distribution is then due to the patchy nature of the environment and/or the inherent heterogeneity of the species. The method can be used whenever we wish to model the data as a response variable in terms of one or more explanatory variables. The analysis consists of three stages. The first involves creating two sets of data from the original: one shows whether or not the species is present; the other indicates the logarithm of the abundance when it is present. These are referred to as the ‘presence data' and the ‘log-abundance' data, respectively. The second stage involves modelling the presence data using logistic regression, and separately modelling the log-abundance data using ordinary regression. Finally, the third stage involves combining the two models in order to estimate the expected abundance for a specific set of values of the explanatory variables. A common approach to analyzing this sort of data is to use a ln (y+c) transformation, where c is some constant (usually one). The method we use here avoids the need for an arbitrary choice of the value of c, and allows the modelling to be carried out in a natural and straightforward manner, using well-known regression techniques. The approach we put forward is not original, having been used in both conservation biology and fisheries. Our objectives in this paper are to (a) promote the application of this approach in a wide range of settings and (b) suggest that parametric bootstrapping be used to provide confidence limits for the estimate of expected abundance.},

abstract = {Three sources of errors in ecosystem model have been analyzed: (1) model bias or errors in model structure, (2) measurement error or uncertainty in model parameters, and (3) variability of natural ecosystems. Bias may result from aggregation of a k component model into k-n components. For some models, total error can be segregated into the errors resulting from pair-wise aggregation of components. Minimal errors result if the components with similar turnover times are aggregated, or small components are lumped with larger ones. Propagation of measurement error by Monte Carlo methods shows that errors are affected by model structure, the relationships among parameters and the position of a component within the system. Explicit results indicate that natural variability (genetic, spatial, etc.) is poorly represented by mean parameter values, but predictability is improved if approximate probability distributions are considered.},

Typically, such models are highly integrated, they produce multiple outputs, and standard methods of model analysis are ill suited for evaluating them. We show how multicriteria optimization with Pareto optimality allows for model outputs to be compared to multiple system components simultaneously and improves three areas in which models are used for biological problems. In the study of optimal biological structures, Pareto optimality allows for the identification of multiple solutions possible for organism survival and reproduction, which thereby explains variability in optimal behavior. For model assessment, multicriteria optimization helps to illuminate and describe model deficiencies and uncertainties in model structure. In environmental management and decisionmaking, Pareto optimality enables a description of the trade-offs among multiple conflicting criteria considered in environmental management, which facilitates better-informed decisionmaking.},

abstract = {In the support of environmental management, models are frequently used. The outcomes of these models however, rarely show a perfect resemblance to the real-world system behavior. This is due to uncertainties, introduced during the process of abstracting information about the system to include it in the model. To provide decision makers with realistic information about these model outcomes, uncertainty analysis is indispensable. Because of the multiplicity of frameworks available for uncertainty analysis, the outcomes of such analyses are rarely comparable. In this paper a method for structured identification and classification of uncertainties in the application of environmental models is presented. We adapted an existing uncertainty framework to enhance the objectivity in the uncertainty identification process. Two case studies demonstrate how it can help to obtain an overview of unique uncertainties encountered in a model. The presented method improves the comparability of uncertainty analyses in different model studies and leads to a coherent overview of uncertainties affecting model outcomes. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Even if measurement error could be completely eliminated, biological systems are inherently variable, and there are fundamental limits on the predictability of the temporal dynamics of many critical forcing functions. How do we incorporate the important sources of uncertainty in our ecosystem models and determine confidence in model output? How does uncertainty constrain our approaches to prediction? This chapter addresses these questions in a discussion of fundamental concepts in predictive ecosystem modeling, including, optimal model size, predictive power, uncertainties in empirical y and x variables (y = target variable to be predicted; x = model variable), uncertainties in model structures, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analyses (using Monte Carlo techniques), and uncertainties related to step-by-step predictions. Examples are given for aquatic ecosystems using both statistical regression models and dynamical mass-balance models based on differential equations. To meet demands in ecosystem management for generality, practical usefulness, and predictive power, models should not only as small as possible and driven by readily accessible variables but also be well balanced, which means that the predictions of the variables do not depend too much on inherent uncertainties associated with just one or a few critical model variables. Such poorly balanced models have generic problems, which means that they will have a good predictive power only in a restricted domain.},

This is to take account of the multi-gear nature of the fishery and the spatial structure of the trends in catch rate. The data on whether or not the catch rate is zero and the catch rate given that it is non-zero are analysed separately and then combined to provide indices of abundance. The former analysis is based on assuming the data are Bernoulli random variables. Given the uncertainty about the appropriate error-model to assume when fitting generalized linear models to catch and effort data, four alternative error-models - log-normal, log-gamma, Poisson, and negative binomial were explored when modelling the non-zero catch rates.

abstract = {Neutral landscape models are computer-generated representations of the spatial pattern of habitat. Most are based on a grid of cells, although network (graph theory) representations are increasing. Representation of the landscape varies from binary (habitat – non-habitat) to nearly continuous. The motivations for this approach to the study of landscapes include concepts derived from island biogeography as well as the idea that computer experiments might be substituted for real experiments at such spatial extents. Different spatial patterns can be generated using the three primary algorithms for grid-based neutral landscapes (random, hierarchical, and fractal), while network representations are usually variations on networks derived from observed landscapes. Scale, encompassing both resolution and extent in cellular models as it is in the network models, is an underlying issue that needs to be addressed more explicitly, but it is not a fatal flaw. Numerous applications of neutral landscapes have been developed in assessing actual landscapes, evaluating spatial metrics, and studying landscape connectivity – especially in relation to organism movement or dispersal. Neutral landscapes offer geographers opportunities to pursue spatial questions and to influence questions in landscape ecology.},

We provide a classification of sources of uncertainty under the two main categories and demonstrate how each impacts on applications in ecology and conservation biology. In particular, we demonstrate the importance of recognizing the effect of linguistic uncertainty, in addition to epistemic uncertainty, in ecological applications. The significance to ecology and conservation biology of developing a clear understanding of the various types of uncertainty, how they arise and how they might best be dealt with is highlighted. Finally, we discuss the various general strategies for dealing with each type of uncertainty and offer suggestions for treating compounding uncertainty from a range of sources.},

Leaf size and shape can also affect the efficiency with which the total photosynthetic surface can be arranged, supported, and supplied. Adaptations in leaf form thus touch on several aspects of plant form and function, with implications for thermoregulation (Gates et al., 1968), efficiency of water use (Pakhurst and Loucks, 1972), photosynthetic potential (Cunningham and Strain, 1969), branching and rooting strategies (Givnish and Vermeij, 1976), productivity (Tsunoda, 1972), and, presumably, competitive ability.},

A valid model has no behavior which does not correspond to system behavior; a useful model predicts some system behavior correctly. Since no model is perfect, available ecosystem models may be described as invalid but useful models. Model validation thus requires an objective evaluation of the performance of the model. The following performance criteria are proposed. Adequacy is the fraction of system behavior which is duplicated by the model, and reliability is the fraction of model behavior which duplicates system behavior. Some uses of these criteria in model evaluation are suggested, and Bayes' theorem is used to show how a model of adequacy 0.5 or greater may be used to reduce sample size in an experimental program.},

No prior assumptions of homogeneity are used for the structure of the zero or non-zero values. The method is primarily applicable to fixed-station designs, although extensions to other designs are possible. The maximum likelihood estimation reduces to fitting a GLM to 0/1 values and another GLM to the positive abundance values. The new model is tested on Icelandic groundfish survey data. It is seen that the model can be used for evaluating the effect of different factors on catch rates as well as estimating abundance indices.

Two common measures of the uncertainty inherent in a distribution of possible outcomes are variance and entropy, yet there is currently no standard for when one measure should be used over the other. This paper explores this question using two models of resource uncertainty. For small numbers of discrete possible outcomes, variance is the better measure because it captures the spread between outcomes as well as their differential possibilities. However, variance can categorically fail as a measure of uncertainty when distributions are multimodal or discontinuous, in which case entropy should be used to characterize uncertainty.},

abstract = {Papers presenting ecological data are expected to follow a prescribed pattern. There is no similar, standard method for writing or presenting ecological models. The structure and content of modeling papers varies widely, frequently failing to adequately present the structure of the model and the parameters required to run it. Readers of modeling papers often cannot reproduce the results presented. Because it is unclear what should be included in modeling papers, or reviews of modeling papers, there are no standards as to what constitutes a rigorous evaluation of this type of scientific effort. The result is a wide range in the quality and completeness of modeling papers, and a reduction of the impact of modeling as a tool for research in ecology and ecosystem studies. Models can be the most accessible and transferable form of ecological information. The actual code that produces the dynamics of the model is a quantitative and unambiguous expression of how the results were obtained. Any researcher running the model with the same inputs should obtain the same outputs. However, this form of communication is open only if the actual code of a model is available to other research groups. There is a wide range of practice in terms of availability of code for published models.},

We use a geometric simulation model of branch growth to explore differences in longevity between old-growth Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco and Abies grandis (D. Don ex Lamb.) Lindl. branches. Reiteration is defined through rules that reflect apical dominance relationships, and these rules are used to define shoot cluster units (SCU) on P. menziesii branches. Reiteration through epicormic production dominates growth in simulated P. menziesii branches and is shown to be a major factor that differentiates growth between P. menziesii and A. grandis. Branch growth is shown to be highly sensitive to rules for bifurcation and capacity for reiteration. The rules employed in the model that define epicormic initiation and SCU independence reveal possible physiological mechanisms through which reiteration occurs in P. menziesii. A simple morphological rule fails to simulate branch growth adequately, whereas a physiological rule through epicormic initiation after release from inhibition of a lateral axis yields realistic simulated branches. Branch growth is best simulated through a combination of physiological controls and morphological rules.},

abstract = {In the twentieth century two different forms of hierarchy theory have been frequently conflated. One, the scalar hierarchy, is used in systems science and ecology. It describes constraint relations on dynamics between systems of different scale. It is useful in describing parts and wholes, and processes taking place in such complex structures. The other, the specification hierarchy, is an older discourse dating back to Plato, and, as a theory of development, to Aristotle. In the twentieth century it was relegated to peripheral importance in biology, but has continued to inform social science and psychology. It can be represented as a system of nested classes, the outermost class containing the most general phenomena, the innermost the most highly specified. These integrative levels can be considered as stages of development as well. Each new stage transcends the one before it and integrated it into a new whole. Incredibly, the same statements can be made about a system from these two viewpoints, even though their meanings are logically different.},

abstract = {Many hypotheses have been advanced about factors that control tree longevity. We use a simulation model with multi-criteria optimization and Pareto optimality to determine branch morphologies in the Pinaceae that minimize the effect of growth limitations due to water stress while simultaneously maximizing carbohydrate gain. Two distinct branch morphologies in the Pareto optimal space resemble Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco and Abies grandis (Dougl. ex D. Don) Lindl., respectively. These morphologies are distinguished by their performance with respect to two pathways of compensation for hydraulic limitation: minimizing the mean path length to terminal foliage (Pseudotsuga) and minimizing the mean number of junction constrictions to terminal foliage (Abies). Within these two groups, we find trade-offs between the criteria for foliage display and the criteria for hydraulic functioning, which shows that an appropriate framework for considering tree longevity is how trees compensate, simultaneously, for multiple stresses. The diverse morphologies that are found in a typical old-growth conifer forest may achieve compensation in different ways. The method of Pareto optimization that we employ preserves all solutions that are successful in achieving different combinations of criteria. The model for branch development that we use simulates the process of delayed adaptive reiteration (DAR), whereby new foliage grows from suppressed buds within the established branch structure. We propose a theoretical synthesis for the role of morphology in the persistence of old Pseudotsuga based on the characteristics of branch morphogenesis found in branches simulated from the optimal set. (i) The primary constraint on branch growth for Pseudotsuga is the mean path length; (ii) as has been previously noted, DAR is an opportunistic architecture; and (iii) DAR is limited by the number of successive reiterations that can form. We show that Pseudotsuga morphology is not the only solution to old-growth constraints, and we suggest how the model results should be used to guide future empirical investigation based on the two contrasting morphologies and how the morphological contrast may relate to physiological processes. Our results show that multi-criteria optimization with Pareto optimality has promise to advance the use of models in theory development and in exploration of functional-structural trade-offs, particularly in complex biological systems with multiple limiting factors.},

abstract = {Ecologists attempt to understand the diversity of life with mathematical models. Often, mathematical models contain simplifying idealizations designed to cope with the blooming, buzzing confusion of the natural world. This strategy frequently issues in models whose predictions are inaccurate. Critics of theoretical ecology argue that only predictively accurate models are successful and contribute to the applied work of conservation biologists. Hence, they think that much of the mathematical work of ecologists is poor science. Against this view, I argue that model building is successful even when models are predictively inaccurate for at least three reasons: models allow scientists to explore the possible behaviors of ecological systems; models give scientists simplified means by which they can investigate more complex systems by determining how the more complex system deviates from the simpler model; and models give scientists conceptual frameworks through which they can conduct experiments and fieldwork. Critics often mistake the purposes of model building, and once we recognize this, we can see their complaints are unjustified. Even though models in ecology are not always accurate in their assumptions and predictions, they still contribute to successful science.},

Various criteria for optimal models will follow, along with other techniques for generating adaptive predictions. Returning to the formal argument of adaptation, I shall show that evolutionary history plays a surprisingly small role in the origin and maintenance of contemporary adaptive patterns.

abstract = {Model comparisons in ecology are typically conducted in one of two contexts. First, models are compared to data that have already been collected, although comparisons would be more profitable before data collection because gaps could be avoided in the data needed to differentiate among alternate models. In the second context, models are compared for situations where data cannot be obtained (e.g., long-term responses to climate change). These comparisons can build confidence in the model predictions, but only if the models differ in their underlying structure. It is demonstrated that model dynamics are controlled largely by the overall model structure and not by the details of how individual processes are represented. Models structures from the perspective of several resources might all yield similar predictions for slowly changing or steady-state ecosystems because resource cycles tend to synchronize as ecosystems develop. This synchrony is disrupted by perturbations; therefore, models can be more readily differentiated based on their responses to particular disturbances. Time-series techniques can be used compare the dynamic behavior of models. These techniques can yield useful information on how the model structure might be improved. Finally, modeling is put into the broader perspective of the process of ecological science. It is argued that a division of labor is needed that includes expertise in modeling, tool making, and data collection/experimentation.},

This requires that we confront multiple challenges in the evaluation of complex systems. One challenge is that resilience has proven difficult to quantify; another issue is that the value of model complexity relative to system complexity is disputed; and finally, local methods for assessing uncertainty are inadequate for more complex models. We address these three challenges simultaneously by proposing a means of evaluating ecological resilience via employment of global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis and comparing models of varying complexity. We suggest that probability distribution functions in output from global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis can be interpreted in terms of ball-and-cup diagrams used in systems theory to visualize ecological resilience. This permits quantification of ecological resilience in terms of the probability of whether a system will remain in a pre-existing state or shift to a different state. We outline the methods for using global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to evaluate ecological resilience and provide examples from recent research. We highlight applications of these methods to assessment of ecosystem management options in terms of their ramifications for ecological resilience.},

abstract = {Under a rapidly warming climate, a critical management issue in semiarid forests of western North America is how to increase forest resilience to wildfire. We evaluated relationships between fuel reduction treatments and burn severity in the 2006 Tripod Complex fires, which burned over 70,000 ha of mixed-conifer forests in the North Cascades range of Washington State and involved 387 past harvest and fuel treatment units. A secondary objective was to investigate other drivers of burn severity including landform, weather, vegetation characteristics, and a recent mountain pine beetle outbreak. We used sequential autoregression (SAR) to evaluate drivers of burn severity, represented by the relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio index, in two study areas that are centered on early progressions of the wildfire complex. Significant predictor variables include treatment type, landform (elevation), fire weather (minimum relative humidity and maximum temperature), and vegetation characteristics, including canopy closure, cover type, and mountain pine beetle attack. Recent mountain pine beetle damage was a statistically significant predictor variable with red and mixed classes of beetle attack associated with higher burn severity. Treatment age and size were only weakly correlated with burn severity and may be partly explained by the lack of treatments older than 30 years and the low rates of fuel succession in these semiarid forests. Even during extreme weather, fuel conditions and landform strongly influenced patterns of burn severity. Fuel treatments that included recent prescribed burning of surface fuels were particularly effective at mitigating burn severity. Although surface and canopy fuel treatments are unlikely to substantially reduce the area burned in regional fire years, recent research, including this study, suggests that they can be an effective management strategy for increasing forest landscape resilience to wildfires.},

Although local and basin-scale differences in riverine fish diversity have been analysed as functions of energy availability and habitat heterogeneity, scale-dependent environmental conditions and river discharge, a model that predicts a comprehensive set of system-wide diversity patterns has been hard to find. Here we show that fish diversity patterns throughout the Mississippi-Missouri River System are well described by a neutral metacommunity model coupled with an appropriate habitat capacity distribution and dispersal kernel. River network structure acts as an effective template for characterizing spatial attributes of fish biodiversity. We show that estimates of average dispersal behaviour and habitat capacities, objectively calculated from average runoff production, yield reliable predictions of large-scale spatial biodiversity patterns in riverine systems. The success of the neutral theory in two-dimensional forest ecosystems and here in dendritic riverine ecosystems suggests the possible application of neutral metacommunity models in a diverse suite of ecosystems. This framework offers direct linkage from large-scale forcing, such as global climate change, to biodiversity patterns.},

It is more common to find that the problems and pitfalls of validation and testing are poorly understood, inadequately executed, or entirely ignored. Among the reasons for this are the accelerating pace of technologies for model development has not been matched by the parallel development of methods for model analysis and testing; a trend in increased model complexity often requires the inclusion of critical variables that are unmeasured or unmeasurable (e.g., dispersal in population and metapopulation models); and the short duration of most research projects provides insufficient time and resources for adequate testing of model performance. These challenges are particularly daunting for models that are implemented spatially over large regions (e.g., landscape simulators). These difficulties are further exacerbated by the fact that no single method is suitable for testing all possible models and modeling objectives. Here we review a heuristic approach to model evaluation and present a general method for constructing informative model-data comparisons. Our premise is that models never work in their entirety (they always simplify reality to some extent), but even inadequate models can be used to effectively so long as their behavior is well understood. This approach builds a richer appreciation for how a model matches data and the circumstances under which the model performs best. This fuller understanding of model- data comparisons allows client users to choose cases where the model can be confidently or to take advantage of model bias to obtain conservative results. We believe that a generalized approach to a broad variety of models, including complex ecosystem simulators must be developed. There are pressing needs for formal research on model construction, evaluation, and testing that should be a high priority for all ecosystem scientists.},

abstract = {Modeling has become an important tool in the study of ecological systems,as a scan of the table of con tents of a ny major eco l ogical journ a l makes abundantly clear. A number of books have recently been published that provide excellent advice on model construction, building, and use (e.g.,Gotelli 1995, Gurney and Nisbet 1998, Roughgarden 1998) and add to the classic literature on modeling ecological systems and their dynamics (e.g., Maynard Smith 1974, Nisbet and Gurney 1 9 8 2 ) . Unfortunately, however, little - if any - of this growing literature on ecological modeling addresses the motivation to model and the initial stages of the modeling process, information that beginning students would find useful. Fast computers and graphical software packages have removed much of the drudgery of creating models with a programming language and opened new avenues of model construction,use,and even misuse. There are many reasons why a student might want to consider modeling as a component of his or her education. Models provide an opportunity to explore ideas regarding ecological systems that it may not be possible to field-test for logistical, political, or financial reasons. Often, learning occurs from apparently st range results and unexpected surprises. The process of formulating an ecological model is extremely helpful for organizing one's thinking, bringing hidden assumptions to light, and identifying data needs. More and more,students want to "do something" with modeling but are not sure how to get started. The goals of this article are to outline issues concerning the value of ecological models and some possible motivations for modeling, and to provide an entry point to the established modeling literature so that those who are beginning to think about using models in their research can integrate modeling usefully.We therefore envision the typical reader to be an advanced undergraduate, a beginning graduate student, or a new modeler.We first consider some of the values of models and the motivation for modeling.We then discuss the steps involved in developing a model from an initial idea to something that is implemented on a computer, outlining some of the decisions that must be made along the way. Many excellent texts and journal articles deal with the technical details of models and model construction; we do not attempt to replace this literature, but rather try to make the reader aware of the issues that must be considered and point to some of the sources we have found particularly useful. We begin with the assumption that the reader has decided that he or she would like to "do something" with modeling as part of his or her research (Figure 1). It is important to recognize the difference between models and the modeling process. A model is a representation of a particular thing, idea, or condition. Models can be as simple as a verbal statement about a subject or two boxes connected by an arrow to represent some relationship. Alternatively, models can be extremely complex and detailed, such as a mathematical description of the pathways of nitrogen transformations within ecosystems. The modeling process is the series of steps taken to convert an idea first into a conceptual model and then into a quantitative m odel . Because part of what eco l ogists do is revise hypotheses and collect new data, the model and the view of nature that it represents often undergo many changes from the initial conception to what is deemed the final product. The discussion that follows is organized to consider issues in a sequence similar to what a new modeler would encounter. Because individuals' backgrounds differ, the sequence is not fixed.We map one possible route through the sorts of decisions that will most lik ely need to be considered; this course is derived from our individual experiences plus the collective knowledge of our reviewers. We begin with conceptual models because many people, even self-labeled nonmodelers, formulate conceptual models.},

abstract = {Reiteration is the process whereby architectural units are replicated within a tree. Both immediate (from apical buds) and delayed (from suppressed or adventitious buds) reiteration can be seen in many tree species where architectural units ranging from clusters of shoots to entire branches and stems are replicated. In large old trees and suppressed trees, delayed reiteration occurs without an obvious external stimulus such as defoliation or traumatic loss of the branch apex. This suggests that, in trees that are growth-limited, reiteration is an adaptive mechanism for crown maintenance. We discuss theories about the aging process and how delayed adaptive reiteration may help maintain crown productivity and increase longevity. These include: (1) reducing the respiration/photosynthesis ratio; (2) increasing hydraulic conductance to newly developing foliage; (3) reducing nutrient loss from the tree; and (4) rejuvenating the apical meristem. The ability to reiterate various architectural units may contribute to increasing lifetime reproductive output by prolonging tree longevity. Further studies on the physiological and ecological implications of reiteration are needed to understand its adaptive significance in the life history of trees.},

abstract = {While they can be useful tools to support decision-making in ecosystem management, robust simulation models of ecosystems with alternative states are challenging to build and validate. Because of the possibility of alternative states in model dynamics, no trivial criteria can provide reliable and useful metrics to assess the goodness-of-fit of such models. This paper outlines the development of the model TRITON, and presents simulation-based validation and analysis of model sensitivity to input parameters. TRITON captures the local dynamics of seaweed-based rocky reef communities in eastern Tasmania, which now occur in two alternative persistent states: (1) either as dense and productive seaweed beds, (2) or as sea urchin ‘barrens' habitat, i.e. bare rock largely denuded of macroalgae and benthic invertebrates due to destructive grazing by sea urchins. Pattern-oriented-modelling, i.e. comparing patterns in model dynamics across Monte–Carlo simulations with direct observations of Tasmanian reef communities over large scales, provides a valuable approach to calibrate the dynamics of TRITON. Using the computationally efficient, model-independent extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test, we identify fishing down of predatory lobsters, sea urchin recruitment rate, as well as seaweed growth rate as key parameters of influence on overall model behaviour. Through a set of independent sensitivity tests, we isolate different sets of drivers facilitating the ‘forward' shift from the seaweed bed to the urchin-dominated state, and the reverse or ‘backward' shift from denuded sea urchin barren to recovery of seaweed cover. The model suggests that rebuilding populations of large rock lobsters, which predate the urchins, will be effective in limiting ongoing formation of sea urchins barrens habitat, but that the chances of restoring seaweed beds from extensive barrens are relatively low if management relies solely on rebuilding stocks of large rock lobsters. Moreover, even when it does occur, seaweed bed restoration takes up to three decades in the simulations and so is arguably unrealistic to implement under short-term fishery management plans. The process of model validation provided both a better understanding of the key drivers of community dynamics (e.g. fishing of predatory lobsters), and an assessment of priority areas for future research.},

abstract = {Functional structural models (FSMs) are valuable tools to explore relationships between plant form and function, yet they lack rigorous methods for development and assessment. We use multi-criteria assessment of an architectural FSM to show that both traumatic sequential and adaptive delayed reiteration (ADR) are necessary components of foliage maintenance in branches of oldgrowth Pseudotsuga menziesii. ADR has previously been established as a process that maintains foliage in oldgrowth P. menziesii. We use a simulation model of branch development in the species to evaluate morphogenesis in the context of this ADR. The structure of the model is a theoretical representation of how P. menziesii branch morphology develops throughout the branch lifespan, and this model structure is assessed with two criteria that are optimized simultaneously; the criteria measure foliage demography by the number of foliated shoots, and how those foliated shoots are organized into independent clusters. Assessment results indicated that improvements in model structure were required. Anomalous parameter vectors from the assessment search uncovered an inadequacy in the process of foliage maintenance, and the model was modified to include traumatic sequential reiteration in addition to ADR. The modes of the resulting parameter distributions were consistent with empirical observations. We discuss why the assessment of FSMs is an essential procedure that requires multiple criteria.},

abstract = {Reliable predictions of fuel consumption are critical in the eastern United States (US), where prescribed burning is frequently applied to forests and air quality is of increasing concern. CONSUME and the First Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM), predictive models developed to estimate fuel consumption and emissions from wildland fires, have not been systematically evaluated for application in the eastern US using the same validation data set. In this study, we compiled a fuel consumption data set from 54 operational prescribed fires (43 pine and 11 mixed hardwood sites) to assess each model's uncertainties and application limits. Regions of indifference between measured and predicted values by fuel category and forest type represent the potential error that modelers could incur in estimating fuel consumption by category. Overall, FOFEM predictions have narrower regions of indifference than CONSUME and suggest better correspondence between measured and predicted consumption. However, both models offer reliable predictions of live fuel (shrubs and herbaceous vegetation) and 1 h fine fuels. Results suggest that CONSUME and FOFEM can be improved in their predictive capability for woody fuel, litter, and duff consumption for eastern US forests. Because of their high biomass and potential smoke management problems, refining estimates of litter and duff consumption is of particular importance.},

@article{Rykiel1996,
abstract = {The ecological literature reveals considerable confusion about the meaning of validation in the context of simulation models. The confusion arises as much from semantic and philosophical considerations as from the selection of validation procedures. Validation is not a procedure for testing scientific theory or for certifying the 'truth' of current scientific understanding, nor is it a required activity of every modelling project. Validation means that a model is acceptable for its intended use because it meets specified performance requirements. Before validation is undertaken, (1) the purpose of the model, (2) the performance criteria, and (3) the model context must be specified. The validation process can be decomposed into several components: (1) operation, (2) theory, and (3) data. Important concepts needed to understand the model evaluation process are verification, calibration, validation, credibility, and qualification. These terms are defined in a limited technical sense applicable to the evaluation of simulation models, and not as general philosophical concepts. Different tests and standards are applied to the operational, theoretical, and data components. The operational and data components can be validated; the theoretical component cannot. The most common problem with ecological and environmental models is failure to state what the validation criteria are. Criteria must be explicitly stated because there are no universal standards for selecting what test procedures or criteria to use for validation. A test based on comparison of simulated versus observed data is generally included whenever possible. Because the objective and subjective components of validation are not mutually exclusive, disagreements over the meaning of validation can only be resolved by establishing a convention.},

abstract = {We used the Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FFE-FVS) to simulate fuel treatment effects on 45 162 stands in low- to midelevation dry forests (e.g., ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex. P. {\&} C. Laws.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) of the western United States. We evaluated treatment effects on predicted post-treatment fire behavior (fire type) and fire hazard (torching index). FFE-FVS predicts that thinning and surface fuel treatments reduced crown fire behavior relative to no treatment; a large proportion of stands were predicted to transition from active crown fire pre-treatment to surface fire post-treatment. Intense thinning treatments (125 and 250 residual trees{\textperiodcentered}ha–1) were predicted to be more effective than light thinning treatments (500 and 750 residual trees{\textperiodcentered}ha–1). Prescribed fire was predicted to be the most effective surface fuel treatment, whereas FFE-FVS predicted no difference between no surface fuel treatment and extraction of fuels. This inability to discriminate the effects of certain fuel treatments illuminates the consequence of a documented limitation in how FFE-FVS incorporates fuel models and we suggest improvements. The concurrence of results from modeling and empirical studies provides quantitative support for “fire-safe” principles of forest fuel reduction (sensu Agee and Skinner 2005. For. Ecol.
