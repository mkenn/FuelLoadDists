abstract = {The development of a mathematical model for predicting rate of fire spread and intensity applicable to a wide range of wildland fuels is presented from the conceptual stage through evaluation and demonstration of results to hypothetical fuel models. The model was developed for and is now being used as a basis for appraising fire spread and intensity in the National FireDanger Rating System. The initial work was done using fuel arrays composed of uniform size particles. Three fuel sizes were tested over a wide range of bulk densities. These were 0.026-inch-square cut excelsior, 114-inch sticks, and 112-inch sticks. The problem of mixed fuel sizes was then resolved by weighting the various particle sizes that compose actual fuel arrays by either surface area or loading, depending upon the feature of the fire being predicted. The model is complete in the sense that no prior knowledge of a fuel's burning characteristics is required. All that is necessary are inputs describing the physical and chemical makeup of the fuel and the environmental conditions in which it is expected to burn. Inputs include fuel loading, fuel depth, fuel particle surface-area-to-volume ratio, fuel particle heat content, fuel particle moisture and mineral content, and the moisture content at which extinction can be expected. Environmental inputs are mean wind velocity and slope of terrain. For heterogeneous mixtures, the fuel properties are entered for each particle size. The model as originally conceived was for dead fuels in a uniform stratum contiguous to the ground, such as litter or grass. It has been found to be useful, however, for fuels ranging from pine needle litter to heavy logging slash and for California brush fields. The concept of fuel models is introduced, wherein parameters of wildland fuels necessary for inputs to the model are categbrized and tabulated. These are then used to predict fire spread and intensity; this eliminates the necessity for repeatedly measuring such parameters. The conceptual approach recognizes that fuels have inherent characteristics that are repeatable.},

abstract = {We simulated long-term forest management activities on a 16,000-ha wildland–urban interface in the Blue Mountains near La Grande, Oregon. The study area is targeted for thinning and fuels treatments on both private and Federally managed lands to address forest health and sustainability concerns and reduce the risk of severe wildfire. We modeled a number of benchmark management scenarios through time and examined potential wildfire behavior, stand structure, species composition, and other forest characteristics over the study area. The simulation models indicated that substantial area would require repeated thinning over time to meet desired forest density guidelines for the landscape as a whole. Fire models predicted significant reductions in crown fire activity for a specific weather scenario as a result of thinning and treatment of surface fuels. Substantial changes in stand structure and other characteristics were noted for the thinning versus no-treatment scenarios. The study provided a template of modeling methods and information for forest planners concerned with forest and fuel management issues in the Western United States.},

@article{Turley2009,
abstract = {We present a method of multi-criteria assessment for the analysis of process model uncertainty that combines analysis of model structure, parameters and data requirements. There are three components in calculation and definition of uncertainty. (1) Assessment criteria: Uncertainty in a process model is reduced as the model can simultaneously simulate an increased number of assessment criteria selected to test specific aspects of the theory being investigated, and within acceptable limits set for those criteria. This reduces incomplete specification of the model—the characteristic that a model may explain some, but not all, of the observed features of a phenomenon. The calculation required is computation of the Pareto set which provides the list of simultaneously achieved criteria within specified ranges. (2) Parameter values: Uncertainty in a process model is reduced as the distribution of values for parameters simulating multiple assessment criteria within their acceptable limits becomes unimodal and with reduced range. This reduces non-uniqueness in the model—the characteristic that there may be alternative representations and no a priori way of deciding between them. The calculation required is analysis of parameter values within each group of the Pareto set, for their distributions and possible correlations which contributes to a definition of non-uniqueness in terms of whether multiple modes in parameter values are equally plausible. (3) Data and information: Uncertainty in a process model is reduced as the acceptable limits for assessment criteria are defined with increasing precision. The calculations required are to define acceptability ranges for the assessment criteria either through empirical investigations or through inference from related theories. This provides a definition of the relationship of the model to empirical and theoretical construction thought to be important. Three types of criteria should be used in assessment of uncertainty: (i) Tests of the quantitative domains of the model outputs. (ii) Examination of features explicitly predicted by the theory that the model describes. (iii) Tests between alternative structures in model formulation. The ability of a model to satisfy these criteria simultaneously is calculated using evolutionary computation and results are presented as a Pareto optimal set. Deficiencies in the model are revealed by manipulating acceptable limits around the assessment criteria, inclusion and exclusion of different criteria, and examining the distribution of model parameter values as non-dominated groups achieving different combinations of assessment criteria form in the Pareto optimal set. We illustrate this procedure through application to a simple model of competition between plants in single species even-aged populations. We use six assessment criteria and test an alternative to the model.},

abstract = {With fire suppression, many western forests are expected to have fewer gaps and higher stem density of shade-tolerant species as light competition becomes a more significant influence on stand pattern and composition. We compared species composition, structure, spatial pattern, and environmental factors such as light and soil moisture between two old-growth forests: Pacific Northwest western hemlock/Douglas-fir at the Wind River Canopy Crane Research Facility exhibiting gap-phase replacement and southern Sierra Nevada mixed conifer at the Teakettle Experimental Forest after 135 years without a fire. We hypothesized that fire suppression at Teakettle would create a current tree composition and distribution more like Wind River where light is an important influence on stand dynamics. Wind River has nearly continuous canopy cover and a high foliage volume that severely reduces understory light and stratifies the canopy composition by shade tolerance. Large trees are regularly spaced from 0 to 15 m and shade-tolerant and intolerant species are “repelled.” In contrast, Teakettle's canopy cover is discontinuous, foliage volume is one-fifth that of Wind River, and understory light is 15 times higher. Trees at Teakettle are significantly clustered in groups containing a mix of shade-tolerant and -intolerant species, separated by large gaps. Although Teakettle's gaps have higher moisture and a thinner litter layer than tree groups, regeneration in gaps is scarce. Fire suppression has increased stem density at Teakettle but it has not filled in gaps, stratified the canopy by shade tolerance, or produced a composition consistent with patterns at Wind River. Teakettle's distinctly clustered stem distribution may result from a minimum canopy cover threshold needed for tree establishment. If high temperatures produced by direct sunlight inhibit stem patterns, traditional stand management that reduces canopy cover to release regeneration should be applied with caution in the southern Sierra Nevada.},

abstract = {Reiteration is an important process in the maintenance of tree crowns and in plant longevity. We use a geometric simulation model of branch growth to explore differences in longevity between old-growth Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco and Abies grandis (D. Don ex Lamb.) Lindl. branches. Reiteration is defined through rules that reflect apical dominance relationships, and these rules are used to define shoot cluster units (SCU) on P. menziesii branches. Reiteration through epicormic production dominates growth in simulated P. menziesii branches and is shown to be a major factor that differentiates growth between P. menziesii and A. grandis. Branch growth is shown to be highly sensitive to rules for bifurcation and capacity for reiteration. The rules employed in the model that define epicormic initiation and SCU independence reveal possible physiological mechanisms through which reiteration occurs in P. menziesii. A simple morphological rule fails to simulate branch growth adequately, whereas a physiological rule through epicormic initiation after release from inhibition of a lateral axis yields realistic simulated branches. Branch growth is best simulated through a combination of physiological controls and morphological rules.},

abstract = {There is considerable concern over the occurrence of stand-replacing fire in forest types historically associated with low- to moderate-severity fire. The concern is largely over whether contemporary levels of stand-replacing fire are outside the historical range of variability, and what natural forest recovery is in these forest types following stand-replacing fire. In this study we quantified shrub characteristics and tree regeneration patterns in stand-replacing patches for five fires in the northern Sierra Nevada. These fires occurred between 1999 and 2008, and our field measurements were conducted in 2010. We analyzed tree regeneration patterns at two scales: patch level, in which field observations and spatial data were aggregated for a given stand-replacing patch, and plot level. Although tree regeneration densities varied considerably across sampled fires, over 50 % of the patches and approximately 80 % all plots had no tree regeneration. The percentage of patches, and to a greater extent plots, without pine regeneration was even higher, 72 and 87 %, respectively. Hardwood regeneration was present on a higher proportion of plots than either the pine or non-pine conifer groups. Shrub cover was generally high, with approximately 60 % of both patches and individual plots exceeding 60 % cover. Patch characteristics (size, perimeter-to-area ratio, distance-to-edge) appeared to have little effect on observed tree regeneration patterns. Conifer regeneration was higher in areas with post-fire management activities (salvage harvesting, planting). Our results indicate that the natural return of pine/mixed-conifer forests is uncertain in many areas affected by stand-replacing fire.},

abstract = {Published scientific literature contains many studies estimating life
cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of residential and utility-scale
solar photovoltaics (PVs). Despite the volume of published work,
variability in results hinders generalized conclusions. Most variance
between studies can be attributed to differences in methods and
assumptions. To clarify the published results for use in decision making
and other analyses, we conduct a meta-analysis of existing studies,
harmonizing key performance characteristics to produce more comparable
and consistently derived results. Screening 397 life cycle assessments
(LCAs) relevant to PVs yielded 13 studies on crystalline silicon (c-Si)
that met minimum standards of quality, transparency, and relevance.
Prior to harmonization, the median of 42 estimates of life cycle GHG
emissions from those 13 LCAs was 57 grams carbon dioxide equivalent per
kilowatt-hour (g CO2-eq/kWh), with an interquartile range (IQR) of 44 to
73. After harmonizing key performance characteristics (irradiation of
1,700 kilowatt-hours per square meter per year (kWh/m2/yr); system
lifetime of 30 years; module efficiency of 13.2% or 14.0%, depending
on module type; and a performance ratio of 0.75 or 0.80, depending on
installation, the median estimate decreased to 45 and the IQR tightened
to 39 to 49. The median estimate and variability were reduced compared
to published estimates mainly because of higher average assumptions for
irradiation and system lifetime. For the sample of studies evaluated,
harmonization effectively reduced variability, providing a clearer
synopsis of the life cycle GHG emissions from c-Si PVs. The literature
used in this harmonization neither covers all possible c-Si
installations nor represents the distribution of deployed or
manufactured c-Si PVs.},

abstract = {Aim To evaluate the climate sensitivity of model-based forest productivity esti- mates using a continental-scale tree-ring network. Location Europe and North Africa (30–70° N, 10° W–40° E). Methods We compiled close to 1000 annually resolved records of radial tree growth for all major European tree species and quantified changes in growth as a function of historical climatic variation. Sites were grouped using a neural network clustering technique to isolate spatiotemporal and species-specific climate response patterns. The resulting empirical climate sensitivities were compared with the sensitivities of net primary production (NPP) estimates derived from the ORCHIDEE-FM and LPJ-wsl dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). Results We found coherent biogeographic patterns in climate response that depend upon (1) phylogenetic controls and (2) ambient environmental conditions delineated by latitudinal/elevational location. Temperature controls dominate forest productivity in high-elevation and high-latitude areas whereas moisture sensitive sites are widespread at low elevation in central and southern Europe. DGVM simulations broadly reproduce the empirical patterns, but show less tem- perature sensitivity in the boreal zone and stronger precipitation sensitivity towards the mid-latitudes. Main conclusions Large-scale forest productivity is driven by monthly to sea- sonal climate controls, but our results emphasize species-specific growth patterns under comparable environmental conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that carry-over effects fromthe previous growing season can significantly influence tree growth, particularly in areas with harsh climatic conditions – an element not considered in most current-state DGVMs. Model–data discrepancies suggest that the simulated climate sensitivity of NPP will need refinement before carbon-cycle climate feedbacks can be accurately quantified.

abstract = {Scaling leaf-level measurements to estimate carbon gain of entire leaf crowns or canopies requires an understanding of the distribution of photosynthetic capacity and corresponding light microenvironments within a crown. We have compared changes in the photosynthetic light response and nitrogen (N) content (per unit leaf area) of Pinus contorta Dougl. ssp. latifolia Engelm. (lodgepole pine) leaves in relation to their age and light microenvironment. The vertical gradient in integrated daily photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) from the upper to the lower crown of lodgepole pine was similar in magnitude to the horizontal gradient in daily PPFD along shoots from young to old leaves. The relationship between light-saturated net photosynthesis (A(max)) and daily PPFD was significant for both young and old leaves. However, old leaves had a lower A(max) than young leaves in a similar daily irradiance regime. For leaves of all ages from throughout the crown, A(max) was linearly related to the estimated daily net carbon gain that leaves could achieve in their natural PPFD environment (estimated A(day)) (r(2) = 0.84, P < 0.001, n = 39), indicating that estimated A(day) may be dominated by carbon fixed when leaves are light-saturated and operating at A(max). Comparison of the PPFD required to achieve A(max) and the PPFD available to the leaves showed that all of the measured leaves (n = 39), regardless of their position in the crown or age, were in light environments that could light-saturate photosynthesis for a similar proportion of the day. For all data pooled, foliar N was weakly correlated with daily PPFD. Analyzing each leaf age class separately showed that foliar N was significantly related to daily PPFD, A(max), and estimated A(day) for the youngest leaves but not for middle-aged or old leaves. Therefore, the general theory that foliar N is allocated within a crown according to total daily light availability was supported only for young (1-4 years old) leaves in this study.},

been proposed in the past and applied to water resources planning. The

In this paper an attempt is made to demonstrate the use of ELECTRE

(iii) drinking water, (iv) environmental quality; (v) floods and (vi)
cost of the project. Out of the six criteria two, namely environmental
quality and floods, are qualitative in nature. A set of best
alternative systems with their partial ordering is obtained from
ELECTRE-I, which forms the input for ELECTRE-II. Complete ordering of
the reduced alternatives is achieved with ELECTRE-II. Sensitivity
analysis shows that changing the weights assigned to each criterion has
greater effect on the results than does changing the scales. However,
neither effect is significant. Therefore it is recommended that
ELECTRE-I be used for screening alternatives under consideration and
ELECTRE-II for complete ordering of the reduced set.},

abstract = {Dry western forests (e.g., ponderosa pine and mixed conifer) were thought to have been historically old and park-like, maintained by low-severity fires, and to have become denser and more prone to high-severity fire. In the Pacific Northwest, early aerial photos (primarily inWashington), showed that dry forests instead had variable-severity fires and forest structure, but more detail is needed. Here I used pre-1900 General Land Office Surveys, with new methods that allow accurate reconstruction of detailed forest structure, to test eight hypotheses about historical structure and fire across about 400,000 ha of dry forests in Oregon's eastern Cascades. The reconstructions show that only about 13.5%of these forests had low tree density. Forests instead were generally dense (mean¼249 trees/ha), but density varied by a factor of 2–4 across about 25,000-ha areas. Shade-tolerant firs historically were 17% of trees, dominated about 12% of forest area, and were common in forest understories. Understory trees and shrubs dominated on 83.5%, and were dense across 44.8% of forest area. Small trees (10–40 cm dbh) were .50% of trees across 72.3% of forest area. Low-severity fire dominated on only 23.5%, mixed-severity fire on 50.2%, and high-severity fire on 26.2% of forest area. Historical fire included modest-rotation (29–78 years) low- severity and long-rotation (435 years) high-severity fire. Given historical variability in fire and forest structure, an ecological approach to restoration would restore fuels and manage for variable-severity fires, rather than reduce fuels to lower fire risk. Modest reduction in white fir/grand fir and an increase in large snags, down wood, and large trees would enhance recovery from past extensive logging and increase resiliency to future global change. These forests can be maintained by wildland fire use, coupled, near infrastructure, with prescribed fires that mimic historical low-severity fires.},

abstract = {An understanding of the factors governing sciurid abundance in the Pacific Northwest is essential for prescribing forest management practices for second-growth forests where recovery of Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis) populations and enhancement of bio- diversity are objectives. We compared results of companion studies of sciurids in western Washington and Oregon and examined patterns of abundance in relation to habitat elements on the Olympic Peninsula to elucidate governing factors and make recommendations for forest management. Regional contrasts show that Glaucomys sabrinus and Tamias town- sendii in Douglas-fir forests in Oregon are 4 times more abundant than in western hemlock forests in Washington, and dietaries of Glaucomys, and the fungal communities that provide its food, are more diverse in Oregon than in Washington. Glaucomys sabrinus in old forests are 2 times more abundant than in young, managed forests without old-forest legacies (large live trees, large snags and large, decaying fallen trees); populations in young forests with old-forest legacies and with understory development may equal those in old growth. On the Olympic Peninsula, Glaucomys sabrinus abundance can be predicted by density of large snags and abundance of ericaceous shrubs. At least seven large snags/ha and well-distributed patches of dense shrubs (cover within patches >24% and patches covering 40% of the total area) are necessary for high densities of Glaucomys sabrinus. Abundance of Tamias town- sendii reflects size of dominant tree and well-developed understories. Abundance of Tami- asciurus douglasii seems to reflect territoriality in concordance with food supply and was greatest where Glaucomys and Tamias were low in abundance. Patterns of abundance of the sciurids in old- and managed forests suggests that silvicultural manipulation of vege- tation and creative snag or den-tree management could be used in a management strategy to accelerate the development of Spotted Owl habitat in areas where old growth is lacking.},

abstract = {Wildland fires are one of the main alleged examples of Self-Organised Criticality (SOC), with simple SOC models resulting in the expectation of a power-law fire size frequency distribution. Here, we test whether fire size distributions systematically follow a power law and analyse their spatial variation for eight distinct areas over the globe. For each of the areas, we examine the fire size frequency distribution using two types of plots, maximum likelihood estimation and chi-square tests. Log-normal emerges as a suitable option to fit the fire size distribution in this variety of environments. In only two of eight areas was the power law (which is a particular case of the log-normal) not rejected. Notably, the two parameters of log-normal are related to each other, displaying a general linear relation, which extends to the sites that can be described with a power law. These results do not necessarily refute the SOC hypothesis, but reveal the presence of other processes that are, at least, modulating the outcome of SOC in some areas.},

abstract = {Techniques for modeling burn probability (BP) combine the stochastic components of fire regimes (ignitions and weather) with sophisticated fire growth algorithms to produce high-resolution spatial estimates of the relative likelihood of burning. Despite the numerous investigations of fire patterns from either observed or simulated sources, the specific influence of environmental factors on BP patterns is not well understood. This study examined the relative effects of ignitions, fuels, and weather on mean BP and spatial patterns in BP (i.e., BP variability) using highly simplified artificial landscapes and wildfire simulation methods. Our results showed that a limited set of inputs yielded a wide range of responses in the mean and spatial patterning of BP. The input factors contributed unequally to mean BP and to BP variability: so-called top-down controls (weather) primarily influenced mean BP, whereas bottom-up influences (ignitions and fuels) were mainly responsible for the spatial patterns of BP. However, confounding effects and interactions among factors suggest that fully separating top-down and bottom-up controls may be impossible. Furthermore, interactions among input variables produced unanticipated but explainable BP patterns, hinting at complex topological dependencies among the main determinants of fire spread and the resulting BP. The results will improve our understanding of the spatial ecology of fire regimes and help in the interpretation of patterns of fire likelihood on real landscapes as part of future wildfire risk assessments.},

abstract = {Stand structure and fuel mass were measured before and after a post-fire logging operation conducted 2 years after the 1996 Summit Wildfire (Malheur National Forest), in a ponderosa pine-dominated forest in northeastern Oregon. Variables were measured both pre- and post-logging in four replicate units for each of three treatments [un-logged control, commercial harvest (most dead merchantable trees removed), fuel reduction harvest (most dead merchantable trees removed plus most dead trees >10 cm diameter)]. Post-fire logging resulted in a significant decrease in mean basal area, down to 46% pre-treatment level in commercial units, and down to 25% in fuel reduction units. Logging significantly reduced tree density, especially for the smallest (<22 cm diameter) and intermediate (23–41 cm) diameter classes. Fuel reduction units also had significantly fewer snags (dead trees >30 cm diameter—4 ha1), compared to both commercial (23 ha1) units and to un-logged controls (64 ha1) in the year following timber harvest. Logging did not change ladder height or tree species composition (% ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir and grand fir). Total woody fuel mass increased significantly in fuel reduction units when compared to controls, with the greatest difference among treatments occurring in the slash fuel (<7.6 cm diameter) component (mean of 6.2 Mg/ha for fuel reduction stands versus 1.3 Mg/ha for un-logged stands). Logging activity caused no change in the mass of the forest floor (litter or duff). Model projections of the fuel bed using the fire and fuels extension of the forest vegetation simulator (FVS–FFE) indicate that the disparity in slash fuel mass between fuel reduction and un-logged units would be sustained until about 15 years post-logging, but a re-burn of moderate intensity occurring during this time would likely kill all young trees, even in un-logged units, because of the influence of other components of the fuel bed, such as grasses and shrubs. Model projections of 1000-h fuels (woody fuels >7.6 cm diameter) indicate that standing structure in all stands would collapse quickly, with the result that un-logged stands would contain two- or three-fold greater masses at 25 and 50 years post-logging, leading to much higher consumption rates of fuel in the event of a re-burn in the same place. Variation in dead tree fall and decay rates did not change the relationship among treatments in 1000-h fuel loads, but changed the time at which treatment differences were projected to disappear. Despite treatment differences in heavy fuel accumulations over time however, FVS–FFE predicts no differences among treatments in mortality of young trees due to either moderate or high intensity fire occurring in the same place at 25, 50, or 100 years post-fire logging. The lack of a re-burn effect is in part due to the reliance on flame length as the primary mechanism leading to tree death in the fire effect models used by FVS–FFE. If tree death turns out to be caused more by root burning or cambial heating, the observed variations in 1000-h fuel loadings among treatments could be significant in the event of a future re-burn.},

abstract = {Observed changes in climate of the U.S. Pacific Northwest since the early twentieth century were examined using four different datasets. Annual mean temperature increased by approximately 0.68–0.88C from 1901 to 2012, with corroborating indicators including a lengthened freeze-free season, increased temperature of the coldest night of the year, and increased growing-season potential evapotranspiration. Seasonal temperature trends over shorter time scales (,50 yr) were variable. Despite increased warming rates in most seasons over the last half century, nonsignificant cooling was observed during spring from 1980 to 2012. Observations show a long-term increase in spring precipitation; however, decreased summer and autumn precipitation and increased potential evapotranspiration have resulted in larger climatic water deficits over the past four decades. A bootstrapped multiple linear regression model was used to better resolve the temporal heterogeneity of seasonal temperature and precipitation trends and to apportion trends to internal climate variability, solar variability, volcanic aerosols, and anthropogenic forcing. The El Ni$\sim$no–Southern Oscillation and the Pacific– North American pattern were the primary modulators of seasonal temperature trends on multidecadal time scales: solar and volcanic forcing were nonsignificant predictors and contributed weakly to observed trends. Anthropogenic forcing was a significant predictor of, and the leading contributor to, long-term warming; natural factors alone fail to explain the observed warming. Conversely, poor model skill for seasonal precipitation suggests that other factors need to be considered to understand the sources of seasonal precipitation trends.},

In earlier work, the fractal dimensions of 3-blocks, d(3), in 2D (two dimensional) and 3D were found to be 1.20+/-0.1 and 1.15+/-0.1, respectively, consistent with the possibility that the fractal dimension might be the same in all dimensions. We find that the fractal dimension of 3-blocks decreases rapidly in higher dimensions, and estimate d(3)=0.7+/-0.2 (4D) and 0.5+/-0.2 (5D). At the upper critical dimension of percolation, d(c)=6, our simulations are consistent with d(3)=0 with logarithmic corrections to power-law scaling.},

abstract = {The effects of weather, terrain, fuels on fire severity were compared
using remote sensing of the severity of two large fires in
south-eastern Australian forests. The probability of contrasting levels
of fire severity (fire confined to the understorey vs. tree canopies
consumed) was analysed using logistic regression. These severities
equate to extremes of fire intensity (< 1,500 vs. > 10,000 kW m(-1)),
consequent suppression potential (high vs. nil) and potential adverse
ecological impacts on vertebrate fauna and soils (low vs. high).
Weather was the major influence on fire severity. Crown fire was absent
under non-extreme weather and but more likely under extreme weather,
particularly on ridges in vegetation unburnt for > 10 years. Crown fire
probability was very low in recently burnt vegetation (1-5 years) and
increased at higher fuel ages. In all cases, fire severity was lower in
valleys, probably due to effects of wind protection and higher fuel
moisture in moderating fire behaviour. Under non-extreme weather, fires
are likely to be suppressible and burn heterogeneously, due to the
influence of topographic position, slope and fuel load. Under extreme
weather, fires are influenced only by fuel and topographic position,
and probability of suppression on accessible ridges will be low except
in recently burnt (i.e. 1-5 year old) fuels. Topographically imposed
variation may mitigate adverse ecological effects on arboreal fauna and
soil erosion potential.},

abstract = {Understanding the longevity of fuel treatments in terms of their ability to maintain fire behavior and effects within a desired range is an important question. The objective of this study was to determine how fuels, forest structure, and predicted fire behavior changed 7-years after initial treatments. Three dif- ferent treatments: mechanical only, mechanical plus fire, and prescribed fire only, as well as untreated control, were each randomly applied to 3 of 12 experimental units. Many aspects of the initial fuel treat- ments changed in 7 years. The overall hazard of the control units increased significantly indicating con- tinued passive management has further increased already high fire hazards. Mechanical only fire hazard decreased after 7 years and are now similar to the two fire treatments, which both maintained low haz- ards throughout the study. Tree density declined significantly 7 years after the initial fire only treatments, while basal area in both fire treatments was unchanged relative to immediate post-treatment conditions. Our findings indicating reduced fire hazard over time in mechanical only treatments might provide an opportunity for a staggered treatment schedule that included prescribed fire which could increase overall treatment longevity to approximately 20 years. Changes in our mixed conifer forests after fuel treatment were generally larger than those reported from ponderosa pine forests in the Rocky Mountains.},

In two of the cases we found that the common interest was mostly served, while in the third case it was not.

abstract = {Background and Aims Constructing functional-structural plant models (FSPMs) is a valuable method for examining how physiology and morphology interact in determining plant processes. However, such models always have uncertainty concerned with whether model components have been selected and represented effectively, with the number of model outputs simulated and with the quality of data used in assessment. We provide a procedure for defining uncertainty of an FSPM and how this uncertainty can be reduced. Methods An important characteristic of FSPMs is that typically they calculate many variables. These can be variables that the model is designed to predict and also variables that give indications of how the model functions. Together these variables are used as criteria in a method of multi-criteria assessment. Expected ranges are defined and an evolutionary computation algorithm searches for model parameters that achieve criteria within these ranges. Typically, different combinations of model parameter values provide solutions achieving different combinations of variables within their specified ranges. We show how these solutions define a Pareto Frontier that can inform about the functioning of the model. Key Results The method of multi-criteria assessment is applied to development of BRANCHPRO, an FSPM for foliage reiteration on old-growth branches of Pseudotsuga menziesii. A geometric model utilizing probabilities for bud growth is developed into a causal explanation for the pattern of reiteration found on these branches and how this pattern may contribute to the longevity of this species. Conclusions FSPMs should be assessed by their ability to simulate multiple criteria simultaneously. When different combinations of parameter values achieve different groups of assessment criteria effectively a Pareto Frontier can be calculated and used to define the sources of model uncertainty.},

abstract = {Abstract. Disturbances such as fire, insect outbreaks, and blowdown are important in shaping subalpine forests in the Rocky Mountains, but quantitative studies of their interactions are rare. We investigated the combined effects of past disturbances, current vegetation, and topography on spatial variability of the severity of a fire that burned approximately 4500 ha of subalpine forest during the extreme drought of 2002 in northwestern Colorado. Ordinal logistic regression was used to spatially model fire severity in relation to late 1800s fires, a 1940s spruce beetle outbreak, forest cover type, stand structure, and topography. The late 1800s fires reduced the probability of burning in 2002, and the 1940s beetle outbreak slightly increased the probability of fire, particularly at high severity. Aspen (Populus tremuloides) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands, which established after the late 1800s fires, were less likely to burn, whereas Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii)– subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) stands were more likely to burn. The highest elevations ($3100 m) had the lowest probability of burning, whereas intermediate elevations (2900–3100 m) had an increased probability of burning at high severity. The influences of the late 1800s fires and 1940s beetle outbreak on stand structure and forest cover type may be more important than their direct effects on fuels. The most important predictors determining fire severity were stand structure, forest cover type, the late 1800s fires, and elevation. Although, in other studies, the effects of pre-burn stand conditions and topography declined with increasingly severe fire weather, in the case of the 2002 fire in Colorado, these predictors explained 42% of the variability of fire severity. Thus, these results suggest that pre-burn stand conditions are important influences on burn severity even for fires burning during extreme drought.},

abstract = {Classical field theory studies interaction at a distance. In this study, interactions among neighboring plants located at a distance from each other have been simulated using an approach termed 'ecological field theory'. Such an approach requires simplifying and redefining biological terms appropriate to ecological field theory concepts, particularly interference and interference potential. Interference is the influence of a plant upon its neighbors' environment through resource competition or less direct interaction. Interference potential is the interference that a newly germinated seedling must overcome to establish itself and subsequently grow at a given site within the influence of all neighboring plants. It is calculated in terms of the effect of their crowns, stems and roots upon the spatial distribution of water, nutrients and light. A continuous-time Markov technique is used to integrate spatial variability in water, light and nutrients into a quantitative estimate of interference potential. These concepts are applied to interference potential in a semi-arid woodland community.},

@article{Kaitaniemi2012,
abstract = {Ecological systems contain a huge amount of quantitative variation between and within species and locations, which makes it difficult to obtain unambiguous verification of theoretical predictions. Ordinary experiments consider just a few explanatory factors and are prone to providing oversimplified answers because they ignore the complexity of the factors that underlie variation. We used multi-objective optimization (MO) for a mechanistic analysis of the potential ecological and evolutionary causes and consequences of variation in the life-history traits of a species of moth. Optimal life-history solutions were sought for environmental conditions where different life stages of the moth were subject to predation and other known fitness-reducing factors in a manner that was dependent on the duration of these life stages and on variable mortality rates. We found that multi-objective optimal solutions to these conditions that the moths regularly experience explained most of the life-history variation within this species. Our results demonstrate that variation can have a causal interpretation even for organisms under steady conditions. The results suggest that weather and species interactions can act as underlying causes of variation, and MO acts as a corresponding adaptive mechanism that maintains variation in the traits of organisms.},

Strong similarities are seen betweenmodels developed at the same institution, between models sharing versions of the same atmospheric component, and between successive versions of the same model. A perturbed parameter ensemble of a model appears separate from other structurally different models. The results provide insight into intermodel relationships, into how models evolve through successive generations, and suggest that assuming model independence in such ensembles of opportunity is not justified},

abstract = {The forest-fire model with immune trees (FFMIT) is a cellular automaton early proposed by Drossel and Schwabl [Physica A 199, 183 (1993)], in which each site of a lattice can be in three possible states: occupied by a tree, empty, or occupied by a burning tree (fire). The trees grow at empty sites with probability p, healthy trees catch fire from adjacent burning trees with probability (1 - g), where g is the immunity, and a burning tree becomes an empty site spontaneously. In this paper we study the FFMIT by means of the recently proposed gradient method (GM), considering the immunity as a uniform gradient along the horizontal axis of the lattice. The GM allows the simultaneous treatment of both the active and the inactive phases of the model in the same simulation. In this way, the study of a single-valued interface gives the critical point of the active-absorbing transition, whereas the study of a multivalued interface brings the percolation threshold into the active phase. Therefore we present a complete phase diagram for the FFMIT, for all range of p, where, besides the usual active-absorbing transition of the model, we locate a transition between the active percolating and the active nonpercolating phases. The average location and the width of both interfaces, as well as the absorbing and percolating cluster densities, obey a scaling behavior that is governed by the exponent alpha = 1/(1 + nu), where nu is the suitable correlation length exponent (nu(perpendicular to) for the directed percolation transition and nu for the standard percolation transition). We also show that the GM allows us to calculate the critical exponents associated with both the order parameter of the absorbing transition and the number of particles in the multivalued interface. Besides, we show that by using the gradient method, the collapse in a single curve of cluster densities obtained for samples of different side is a very sensitive method in order to obtain the critical points and the percolation thresholds.},

Data were collected and analyzed separately for (1) plantations and (2) uncut and partial-cut stands. Ordinal logistic regression was the primary analytical technique used. Factors significantly related to degree of fire damage in plantations were cover of grasses, cover of forbs, elevation, site preparation method, and level of damage in the adjacent stand. Damage to uncut and partial-cut stands depended on stand treatment, primary tree species, and aspect. The variables that most strongly influenced fire damage tended to be those most directly related to management activities-site preparation method and damage in adjacent stand for plantations, and stand treatment for uncut and partial-cut stands.},

For three tasks, phenotypes fall within a triangle in phenotype space, whose vertices are the archetypes, as evident in morphological studies, including on Darwin's finches. Tasks can be inferred from measured phenotypes based on the behavior of organisms nearest the archetypes.},

We consider the problem of finding the fire traversal time across a landscape considering wind speed as an unpredictable phenomenon. The landscape is represented as a graph network and fire propagation time is modeled as the Stochastic Shortest Path problem. Monte-Carlo simulation is utilized to determine the fire travel-time distribution. A network size reduction methodology is introduced to quicken the simulation time by eliminating the unimportant parts of the network. This methodology is implemented in Java to simulate the wildfire propagation on a study area located in Massachusetts. This method shows the capability of substantially reducing the simulation time without affecting prediction accuracy, enabling the algorithm to serve as a fast and reliable tool for fire prediction.},

@article{Littell2009,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to quantify climatic controls on the area burned by fire in different vegetation types in the western United States. We demonstrate that wildfire area burned (WFAB) in the American West was controlled by climate during the 20th century (1916-2003). Persistent ecosystem-specific correlations between climate and WFAB are grouped by vegetation type (ecoprovinces). Most mountainous ecoprovinces exhibit strong year-of-fire relationships with low precipitation, low Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), and high temperature. Grass- and shrub-dominated ecoprovinces had positive relationships with antecedent precipitation or PDSI. For 1977-2003, a few climate variables explain 33-87% (mean = 64%) of WFAB, indicating strong linkages between climate and area burned. For 1916-2003, the relationships are weaker, but climate explained 25-57% (mean = 39%) of the variability. The variance in WFAB is proportional to the mean squared for different data sets at different spatial scales. The importance of antecedent climate (summer drought in forested ecosystems and antecedent winter precipitation in shrub and grassland ecosystems) indicates that the mechanism behind the observed fire-climate relationships is climatic preconditioning of large areas of low fuel moisture via drying of existing fuels or fuel production and drying. The impacts of climate change on fire regimes will therefore vary with the relative energy or water limitations of ecosystems. Ecoprovinces proved a useful compromise between ecologically imprecise state-level and localized gridded fire data. The differences in climate-fire relationships among the ecoprovinces underscore the need to consider ecological context (vegetation, fuels, and seasonal climate) to identify specific climate drivers of WFAB. Despite the possible influence of fire suppression, exclusion, and fuel treatment, WFAB is still substantially controlled by climate. The implications for planning and management are that future WFAB and adaptation to climate change will likely depend on ecosystem-specific, seasonal variation in climate. In fuel-limited ecosystems, fuel treatments can probably mitigate fire vulnerability and increase resilience more readily than in climate-limited ecosystems, in which large severe fires under extreme weather conditions will continue to account for most area burned.},

abstract = {In a previous paper, van Werkhoven et al. (2008b) demonstrated that the information content of streamflow observations at a watershed outlet is a dynamic entity and is dependent on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the causal precipitation event. This result has important consequences for distributed hydrological model calibration strategies and for the design of observation networks. However, the conclusions drawn were based only on the analysis of the model parameter sensitivities to the hydrograph peak fit because of the use of the root-mean-square error objective function. An unanswered question is how will the previous result change if alternative objective functions are used? Here we extend the earlier analysis by adding low-flow and water balance objective functions. We study their impact on how much information can be extracted during calibration overall and for specific model components (parameters) using a synthetic rainfall-runoff event. Results suggest that both vertical (within a model cell) and spatial (across cells) sensitivities vary greatly with the objective function used. Timing-related objective functions show sensitivity largely focused on the area close to the outlet, while a volume-based objective function shows sensitivity distributed more evenly across the watershed. These results demonstrate the importance of using multiple evaluation metrics when assessing distributed model predictions. The resultant multiobjective sensitivity maps provide helpful tools for assessing the actual information provided by gauges in observation networks and motivate the need for a new generation of dynamic calibration strategies that would consider how the spatial parameter controls on the model response of interest vary in time.},

abstract = {Fire frequency, area burned, and fire severity are important attributes of a fire regime, but few studies have quantified the interrelationships among them in evaluating a fire year. Although area burned is often used to summarize a fire season, burned area may not be well correlated with either the number or ecological effect of fires. Using the Landsat data archive, we examined all 148 wildland fires (prescribed fires and wildfires) >40 ha from 1984 through 2009 for the portion of the Sierra Nevada centered on Yosemite National Park, California, USA. We calculated mean fire frequency and mean annual area burned from a combination of field- and satellite-derived data. We used the continuous probability distribution of the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) values to describe fire severity. For fires >40 ha, fire frequency, annual area burned, and cumulative severity were consistent in only 13 of 26 years (50 %), but all pair-wise comparisons among these fire regime attributes were significant. Borrowing from long-established practice in climate science, we defined “fire normals” to be the 26 year means of fire frequency, annual area burned, and the area under the cumulative probability distribution of dNBR. Fire severity normals were significantly lower when they were aggregated by year compared to aggregation by area. Cumulative severity distributions for each year were best modeled with Weibull functions (all 26 years, r2 ≥ 0.99; P < 0.001). Explicit modeling of the cumulative severity distributions may allow more comprehensive modeling of climate-severity and area-severity relationships. Together, the three metrics of number of fires, size of fires, and severity of fires provide land managers with a more comprehensive summary of a given fire year than any single metric.},

abstract = {Fuel mapping is a complex and often multidisciplinary process, involving remote sensing, ground-based validation, statistical modelling, and knowledge-based systems. The scale and resolution of fuel mapping depend both on objectives and availability of spatial data layers. We demonstrate use of the Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS) for fuel mapping at two scales and resolutions: the conterminous USA (CONUS) at 1 km resolution and the Wenatchee National Forest, in Washington State, at 25 m resolution. We focus on the classification phase of mapping — assigning a unique fuelbed to each mapped cell in a spatial data layer. Using a rule-based method, we mapped 112 fuelbeds onto 7.8 million 1 km cells in the CONUS, and mapped 34 fuelbeds onto 18 million 25 m cells in the Wenatchee National Forest. These latter 34 fuelbeds will be further subdivided based on quantitative spatial data layers representing stand structure and disturbance history. The FCCS maps can be used for both modelling and management at commensurate scales. Dynamic fuel mapping is necessary as we move into the future with rapid climatic and land-use change, and possibly increasing disturbance extent and severity. The rule-based methods described here are well suited for updating with new spatial data, to keep local, regional, and continental scale fuel assessments current and inform both research and management.},

abstract = {Research into post-wildfire effects began in the United States more than 70. years ago and only later extended to other parts of the world. Post-wildfire responses are typically transient, episodic, variable in space and time, dependent on thresholds, and involve multiple processes measured by different methods. These characteristics tend to hinder research progress, but the large empirical knowledge base amassed in different regions of the world suggests that it should now be possible to synthesize the data and make a substantial improvement in the understanding of post-wildfire runoff and erosion response. Thus, it is important to identify and prioritize the research issues related to post-wildfire runoff and erosion. Priority research issues are the need to: (1) organize and synthesize similarities and differences in post-wildfire responses between different fire-prone regions of the world in order to determine common patterns and generalities that can explain cause and effect relations; (2) identify and quantify functional relations between metrics of fire effects and soil hydraulic properties that will better represent the dynamic and transient conditions after a wildfire; (3) determine the interaction between burned landscapes and temporally and spatially variable meso-scale precipitation, which is often the primary driver of post-wildfire runoff and erosion responses; (4) determine functional relations between precipitation, basin morphology, runoff connectivity, contributing area, surface roughness, depression storage, and soil characteristics required to predict the timing, magnitudes, and duration of floods and debris flows from ungaged burned basins; and (5) develop standard measurement methods that will ensure the collection of uniform and comparable runoff and erosion data. Resolution of these issues will help to improve conceptual and computer models of post-wildfire runoff and erosion processes. ?? 2013.},

However, in order to accomplish complex and multiple management objectives related to forest structure, fuels, and fire disturbance, these two disciplines must be effectively integrated in science and practice.We have linked scientific and management tools to develop an analytical approach that allows resource managers to quantify and evaluate the effectiveness of alternative fuel treatments in dry interior forests of western North America. The principal tool is the Fire and Fuels Extension of the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FFE-FVS) for characterizing fuel succession and fire behaviour, and for quantifying and visualizing stand structure. FFE-FVS provides a user-friendly framework that facilitates rapid evaluation of thinning and surface fuel treatments intended to reduce crown fire potential and fireline intensity. This approach quantifies fire hazard at small and large spatial scales, assists with treatment priorities and schedules, and generates stand and landscape visualizations that facilitate decisions about appropriate fuel treatments.},

abstract = {Fire suppression and past logging have dramatically altered forest conditions in many areas, but changes to within-stand tree spatial patterns over time are not as well understood. The few studies available suggest that variability in tree spatial patterns is an important structural feature of forests with intact frequent fire regimes that should be incorporated in restoration prescriptions. We used a rare dataset consisting of mapped locations for all trees P10 cm in three 4-ha plots in 1929 before logging and in 2007/2008, 78 and 79 years after logging, to assess changes in three spatial components of forest structure: individual trees, tree clusters and gaps. Comparing 1929 old growth to modern conditions, area in gaps decreased from 20% to zero, the percentage of stems that were single trees from 6% to 2% and in small or medium clumps (2–9 trees) from 28% to 9%, while trees in large clumps (P10 trees) increased from 66% to 89%. Concurrent with these changes, canopy cover increased from 45% to 62%, and the average number of trees in a clump increased from 11 to 26, resulting in much more homogenous conditions across the stand. These changes also altered tree size and species associations within different structural groups (i.e., single tree, small, medium and large clumps). In an effort to account for the alteration of the fire regime that had already taken place in 1929 (the last fire recorded in tree rings was in 1889) we also analyzed spatial patterns of 1929 conditions removing all trees <25 cm. In this analysis, 35% of the plot area was in gaps and canopy cover averaged 36%. Tree clusters had an average of 5.2 trees per clump, with 13% of trees being singles, 30% in small clumps, 24% in medium clumps and 33% in large clumps. Our results provide metrics that quantify spatial patterns and composition of individual trees, tree clumps, and gaps under the historical fire regime that may be useful to forest managers. Our study demonstrates that the contemporary forest is more homogeneous than it was historically, and variability that likely provided diverse microclimate and habitat conditions and fostered resilience to a variety of stressors and disturbances such as fire, insects and drought has been lost. Future management may benefit from restoring these structural components.},

@article{Domec2008,
abstract = {Despite renewed interest in the nature of limitations on maximum tree height, the mechanisms governing ultimate and species-specific height limits are not yet understood, but they likely involve water transport dynamics. Tall trees experience increased risk of xylem embolism from air-seeding because tension in their water column increases with height because of path-length resistance and gravity. We used morphological measurements to estimate the hydraulic properties of the bordered pits between tracheids in Douglas-fir trees along a height gradient of 85 m. With increasing height, the xylem structural modifications that satisfied hydraulic requirements for avoidance of runaway embolism imposed increasing constraints on water transport efficiency. In the branches and trunks, the pit aperture diameter of tracheids decreases steadily with height, whereas torus diameter remains relatively constant. The resulting increase in the ratio of torus to pit aperture diameter allows the pits to withstand higher tensions before air-seeding but at the cost of reduced pit aperture conductance. Extrapolations of vertical trends for trunks and branches show that water transport across pits will approach zero at a heights of 109 m and 138 m, respectively, which is consistent with historic height records of 100-127 m for this species. Likewise, the twig water potential corresponding to the threshold for runaway embolism would be attained at a height of approximately 107 m. Our results suggest that the maximum height of Douglas-fir trees may be limited in part by the conflicting requirements for water transport and water column safety.},

We determined: (1) whether light-saturated photosynthetic rates, light compensation points, and respiration rates varied from the upper to the lower canopy, and (2) if light-saturated photosynthetic rates, light compensation points, and respiration rates varied between Douglas-fir and western hemlock. Over a 25-m gradient from the canopy top to the lower canopy, mean light-saturated photosynthetic rates, light compensation points, and respiration rates declined in overstory Douglas-fir and western hemlock needles, paralleling a 65% decline in the mean daily photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). At the canopy top, increasing light-saturated photosynthetic rates relative to lower canopy needles increased carbon uptake at high PPFD. In the lower canopy, reduced respiration rates relative to upper canopy needles increased carbon uptake at low PPFD by reducing the light compensation point. At all canopy positions, western hemlock had lower mean light-saturated photosynthetic rates, light compensation points and respiration rates than Douglas-fir. As a result, western hemlock had higher net photosynthetic rates at low PPFD, but lower net photosynthetic rates at high PPFD compared with Douglas-fir.},

abstract = {A quantitative measure of wildfire risk across a landscape—expected net change in value of re- sources and assets exposed to wildfire—was established nearly a decade ago. Assessments made using that measure have been completed at spatial extents ranging from an individual county to the continental United States. The science of wildfire risk assessment and management continues to build on the basic framework to develop new analysis techniques that address specific fire management problems. This paper reviews central concepts of the basic risk assessment framework and describes several emerging terms and concepts now under development. These new concepts include: 1) describing certain results of stochastic simulation sys- tems as a wildfire event set, 2) defining a biophysical fireshed as the land area where fires can originate and eventually reach a designated point, line or area in a designated period of time, 3) defining a fireplain as the land area where fire originating from a designated point, line or polygon (or set thereof) can reach during a designated period of time, 4) an exceedance probability curve, which plots the magnitude of an event (or its effects) against the likelihood that magnitude will be exceeded during a designated period of time, and 5) an analysis of wildfire Risk Associated with an Ignition Location (RAIL analysis), which characterizes the wildfire risk where the risk originates rather than where it occurs.},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of wildfire regimes is crucial for both regional forest management and predicting global interactions between fire regimes and climate. Accordingly, spatially explicit modeling of forest fire ecosystems is a very active field of research, including both generic and highly specific models. There is, however, a second field in which wildfire has served as a metaphor for more than 20 years: statistical physics. So far, there has been only limited interaction between these two fields of wildfire modeling. Here we show that two typical generic wildfire models from ecology are structurally equivalent to the most commonly used model from statistical physics. All three models can be unified to a single model in which they appear as special cases of regrowth-dependent flammability. This local "ecological memory" of former fire events is key to self-organization in wildfire ecosystems. The unified model is able to reproduce three different patterns observed in real boreal forests: fire size distributions, fire shapes, and a hump-shaped relationship between disturbance intensity (average annual area burned) and diversity of succession stages. The unification enables us to bring together insights from both disciplines in a novel way and to identify limitations that provide starting points for further research.},

abstract = {Altered fuel conditions coupled with changing climate have disrupted fire regimes of forests historically characterised by high-frequency and low-to-moderate-severity fire. Managers use fuel treatments to abate undesirable fire behaviour and effects. Short-term effectiveness of fuel treatments to alter fire behaviour and effects is well documented; however, long-term effectiveness is not well known. We evaluated surface fuel load, vegetation cover and forest structure before and after mechanical and fire-only treatments over 8 years across 11 National Forests in California. Eight years post treatment, total surface fuel load returned to 67 to 79% and 55 to 103% of pretreatment levels following fire-only and mechanical treatments respectively. Herbaceous or shrub cover exceeded pretreatment levels two-thirds of the time 8 years after treatment. Fire-only treatments warranted re-entry at 8 years post treatment owing to the accumulation of live and dead fuels and minimal impact on canopy bulk density. In general, mechanical treatments were more effective at reducing canopy bulk density and initially increasing canopy base height than prescribed fire. However, elevated surface fuel loads, canopy base height reductions in later years and lack of restoration of fire as an ecological process suggest that including prescribed fire would be beneficial.},

abstract = {Red fir (Abies magnifica) forests in the Sierra Nevada are known to demonstrate both shade tolerant and disturbance related regeneration making it difficult to understand the role of disturbances in the regeneration dynamics of the forests. Four stands with different structural characteristics were selected for intensive sampling in order to capture the observed range of structural variability (e.g. composition, age, size and spatial pattern) in an old-growth red fir-western white pine (Pinus monticola) forest in the northern Sierra Nevada. We used detailed stem mapping, stand structural analysis and cross-dated fire scar samples to identify the relationships between disturbances and stand structure. All trees >5 cm dbh within four 0.5-ha plots were aged and mapped. The species composition of the plots was similar but the density and basal area of the tree populations varied among the plots. Red fir density and basal areas are greater than that of western white pine. The age structure indicated continuous, but variable recruitment and there were few seedlings and saplings. The mean point fire return interval was 76 years (range 25-175 years) for the 400-ha study area. Most fires scarred only single samples suggesting that burns were small and patchy, but pulses of recruitment suggest that some fires were moderate in severity. Regeneration pulses coincided with the dates of several fires (e.g. 1636, 1770). Moran's I, a measure of spatial autocorrelation, indicated that red fir and western white pine exhibited positive spatial autocorrelation at short (3-12 m) and intermediate (36-75 m) distances. Groups of similar age trees were spatially discrete and groups of different ages tended to overlap, resulting in an all aged forest. The spatial pattern of tree ages and the record of disturbance indicate that infrequent moderate severity fires have a lasting influence on the structure and development of old-growth red fir forests. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

annote = {Bond percolation with persistence. 3 states: safe (i think that's actually susceptible; S), burning (infected; F), burnt (immune; B).
If probability a burning cell can ignite its von neumann neighbors (each) is q, then each safe cell has a probability of 1-(1-q)^k of becoming ignited. (1-P(not burning), derived this way because P(burning) is an &/or from each burning neighbor). p is the probability of transitioning from burning to burnt (exintguished) (what about b-->s?)

"A critical line separates the set of parameters for whcih a fire can propagate from those for which it cannot"
Two cells i and j (burning and safe), probability j never catches fire from i (so the bond between remains open) is: 
1-T=sum(n)P(n)(1-q)^n, P(n) is probability for cell i to remain burning during n time steps (T is transition? safe->burning?). (not sure, why sum?). P(n)=(1-p)^(n-1)*p
fire propagates if probability T that bond is closed is greater than the threshold (Tc). Can calculate this based on setting T=Tc, where 1-T is as above, and solving for q, to get q=p/((1-Tc)/Tc+p)


for a given medium, p and T depend on climate and topographic conditions, as well as local and instantaneous values. wind and/or slope bias fire propagation. no analytic relationship for these is suggested


Just quote Calderelli on the idea fractal dimension of "fire scar". Compare that model to their model, e.g., interior of fire (fire expansion), above critical region, then fire extinguishes (crosses the critical threshold), in their model the fractal dimension is predicted to be similar to that observed by Calderelli at the hull of the fire

abstract = {Forests dominated by Douglas-fir and western hemlock in the Pacific Northwest of the United States have strongly influenced concepts and policy concerning old-growth forest conservation. Despite the attention to their old-growth characteristics, a tendency remains to view their disturbance ecology in relatively simple terms, emphasizing infrequent, stand-replacing (SR) fire and an associated linear pathway toward development of those old-growth characteristics. This study uses forest stand- and age-structure data from 124 stands in the central western Cascades of Oregon to construct a conceptual model of stand development under the mixed-severity fire regime that has operated extensively in this region. Hierarchical clustering of variables describing the age distributions of shade-intolerant and shade-tolerant species identified six groups, representing different influences of fire frequency and severity on stand development. Douglas-fir trees > 400 years old were found in 84% of stands, yet only 18% of these stands (15% overall) lack evidence of fire since the establishment of these old trees, whereas 73% of all stands show evidence of at least one non-stand-replacing (NSR) fire. Differences in fire frequency and severity have contributed to multiple development pathways and associated variation in contemporary stand structure and the successional roles of the major tree species. Shade-intolerant species form a single cohort following SR fire, or up to four cohorts per stand in response to recurring NSR fires that left living trees at densities up to 45 trees/ha. Where the surviving trees persist at densities of 60-65 trees/ha, the postfire cohort is composed only of shade-tolerant species. This study reveals that fire history and the development of old-growth forests in this region are more complex than characterized in current stand-development models, with important implications for maintaining existing old-growth forests and restoring stands subject to timber management.},

abstract = {Geostatistical stochastic simulation is always combined with Monte Carlo
method to quantify the uncertainty in spatial model simulations.
However, due to the relatively long running time of spatially explicit
forest models as a result of their complexity, it is always infeasible
to generate hundreds or thousands of Monte Carlo simulations. Thus, it
is of great importance to generate a relatively small set of conditional
realizations capturing most of the spatial variability. In this study,
we introduced an effective sampling method (Latin hypercube sampling)
into a stochastic simulation algorithm (LU decomposition simulation).
Latin hypercube sampling is first compared with a common sampling
procedure (simple random sampling) in LU decomposition simulation. Then
it is applied to the investigation of uncertainty in the simulation
results of a spatially explicit forest model, LANDIS. Results showed
that Latin hypercube sampling can capture more variability in the sample
space than simple random sampling especially when the number of
simulations is small. Application results showed that LANDIS simulation
results at the landscape level (species percent area and their spatial
pattern measured by an aggregation index) is not sensitive to the
uncertainty in species age cohort information at the cell level produced
by geostatistical stochastic simulation algorithms. This suggests that
LANDIS can be used to predict the forest landscape change at broad
spatial and temporal scales even if exhaustive species age cohort
information at each cell is not available. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All

abstract = {In trylng to solve multiobjective optimization problems, many traditional methods scalarize the objective vector into a single objective. In those cases, the obtained solution is highly sensitive to the weight vector used in the scalarization process and demands that the user have knowledge about the underlying problem. Moreover, in solving multiobjective problems, designers may be interested in a set of Pareto-optimal points, instead of a single point. Since genetic algorithms (GAS) work with a population of points, it seems natural to use GAS in multiobjective optimization problems to capture a number of solutions simultaneously. Although a vector evaluated GA (VEGA) has been implemented by Schaffer and has been tried to solve a number of multiobjective problems, the algorithm seems to have bias toward some regions. In this paper, we investigate Goldberg's notion of nondominated sorting in GAS along with a niche and speciation method to find multiple Pareto-optimal points simultaneously. The proof-of-principle results obtained on three problems used by Schaffer and others suggest that the proposed method can be extended to higher dimensional and more difficult multiobjective problems. A number of suggestions for extension and application of the algorithm are also discussed.},

abstract = {We compared crown structure among 20-, 40-, and 450-year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii Mirb. (Franco) var. menziesii) trees, and present a conceptual model of crown development. The model is based on the idea that the tree crown can be considered a vertical chronosequence of cohorts of branches that increase in age from upper- to lower-crown. Mean branch volume increased from upper- to lower-crown following the exponential or general logistic growth curve. Maximum branch volume occurred in the lower-crown for 20- and 40-year-old trees, while it occurred in the middle-crown for 450-year-old trees. For the 20- and 40-year-old trees, branch death did not occur in the upper-most part of the crown, and branch density decreased exponentially for the lower one-half and two-thirds of the crown, respectively. For the 450-year-old trees, branch death occurred and branch density decreased exponentially for the full extent of the crown. Epicormic branches increased branch density in the lower-crown, and moderated the rate of decrease in branch density. For the 20- and 40-year-old trees, branch diameter distributions changed from an abundance of small-diameter branches in the upper-crown, to positively skewed bimodal distributions in the middle-crown, and unimodal distributions comprised of surviving large-diameter branches in the lower-crown. For the 450-year-old trees, branch diameter distributions in the upper-crown were unimodal consisting mostly of original branches. In the middle- to lower-crown, branch diameter distributions were bimodal comprised of smalldiameter epicormic branches and large-diameter original branches. For the 20- and 40-year-old trees, the relationship between mean branch volume and branch density showed two distinct phases. In the upper-crown where branch death was not observed, and mean branch volume increased with decreasing height while branch density remained relatively constant. In the middle- to lower-crown where branch death occurred, mean branch volume increased while branch density decreased exponentially with decreasing height. For the 450-year-old trees, branch death occurred, and mean branch volume increased while branch density decreased exponentially with decreasing height for the full extent of the crown. The relationship between mean branch volume and branch density after the onset of branch death defined the branch self-pruning line/curve. This relationship reflected sequential changes in the population structure of cohorts of branches growing under increasingly shady conditions as the crown grows taller and new cohorts develop above old ones. As a result of the combined effects of branch growth and death, vertical distribution of branch volume shifted toward the upper-crown with increasing tree age.},

The approach models both means (location) and variances (dispersion) with their own distinct sets of predictors (continuous and/or categorical), thereby modeling heteroscedasticity. The location sub-model link function is the logit and thereby analogous to logistic regression, whereas the dispersion sub-model is log linear. Real examples show that these models handle the independent observations case readily.

abstract = {The model of competition for light presented here uses modular autonomy to incorporate plasticity in plant growth under competition. Once plants are characterized as composed of modules, then model structure for competition changes in a fundamental way. Interactions between the plant module and its local resource environment must be modeled rather than the traditionally viewed interactions between whole plants and their neighbors. We assume that a plant module interacts with its local resource environment regardless of whether this environment was altered by a neighbor or by the same plant. Two spatial processes are considered: resource acquisition and growth. The spatial pattern of resource acquisition by a module determines a growth and allocation pattern, e.g., the elongation of branches into a gap. The spatial structure of a module and its connection to the whole tree then determines the pattern of resource distribution and resource acquisition of the next time step. Plasticity of plant growth is incorporated by variation in both the efficiency of resource capture of modules and patterns of resource allocation for individuals of different canopy positions and results in individuals in the community having different spatial structures. The model simulates the three-dimensional development of tree crown structure over time. It is applied to the 30-yr development of a dense, spatially aggregated stand of Abies amabilis beginning with an internal pattern seedlings. The importance of incorporation of plasticity is apparent when the model output is compared to observed height distribution and crown structure data. Simulations indicate that asymmetrical crown development, one form of plasticity, is advantageous to stand productivity and becomes more advantageous as the degree of spatial aggregation in the initial spacing of trees increases.},

The prerequisite for the development of any remote sensing application should nevertheless be an understanding of the physical principles behind the spectral signal measured by satelliteor air-borne instruments. The boreal forests of the northern hemisphere, dominated by coniferous tree species, form the largest unbroken forest zone in the world. From the perspective of remote sensing, a widely acknowledged, but poorly explained phenomenon is the generally observed lower spectral reflectances of coniferous forests when compared to broadleaved forests. The only alternative to explaining this phenomenon is studying the radiative transfer process in coniferous canopies. In this dissertation, the relationships of spectral and structural properties of boreal coniferous forests were investigated through empirical and simulation studies, and this new information was applied in LAI retrieval from optical satellite images over conifer-dominated areas in Finland. The first part assessed the effect of macro- and microscale grouping on the spectral signature of coniferous stands. Results indicated that crown size and shape are important factors influencing stand reflectance and that a main explanation for the low reflectances of conifer stands especially in the near infrared wavelengths is the high level of within-shoot scattering. The second part focused on estimating LAI from optical satellite images both using spectral vegetation indices and by inverting a physically based forest reflectance model. Both methods indicated their feasibility for LAI estimation. A general observation was that inclusion of the previously little-used middle infra-red wavelength in both retrieval methods slightly improves the remotely sensed LAI estimates for conifers.},

abstract = {The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) has become a dominant tool in evaluating the accuracy of models predicting distributions of species. ROC has the advantage of being threshold-independent, and as such does not require decisions regarding thresholds of what constitutes a prediction of presence versus a prediction of absence. However,we showthat, comparing two ROCs, using the AUC systematically undervalues models that do not provide predictions across the entire spectrum of proportional areas in the study area. Current ROC approaches in ecological niche modeling applications are also inappropriate because the two error components are weighted equally. We recommend a modification of ROC that remedies these problems, using partial-area ROC approaches to provide a firmer foundation for evaluation of predictions from ecological niche models. A worked example demonstrates that models that are evaluated favorably by traditional ROC AUCs are not necessarily the best when niche modeling considerations are incorporated into the design of the test.},

abstract = {In western Oregon, forest ecosystem processes are greatly affected by patterns of stand replacement disturbance. A spatially explicit characterization of clear-cut logging and wildfire is a prerequisite to understanding the causes and consequences of dis- turbance in this region. We analyzed stand replace- ment disturbance over 4.6 million forested hectares of three major provinces in western Oregon be- tween 1972 and 1995, contrasting the relative amounts of wildfire and harvest in each province and comparing harvest statistics among the domi- nant land ownership categories. Clear-cut harvest and wildfire occurred over 19.9% and 0.7% of the study area, respectively. The moist Coast Range Province (CRP) was dominated by private industrial (PI) ownerships and had the greatest concentration of cutting. The relatively dry Klamath Mountains Province (KMP) and the climatically moderate Western Cascades Province (WCP) were dominated by public landowners and had lower concentrations of cutting and larger amounts of wildfire than the CRP. Rates of harvest over time generally followed similar trends across landowners; it was lowest in the early 1970s, peaked in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and then decreased to near 1970s levels by the mid-1990s. PI landowners had harvest rates that were about two and one-half times as high as public owners throughout the study period. Public and private nonindustrial (PNI) owners tended to have relatively small cutting units that remained spatially dispersed throughout the study period, whereas the PI owners had larger individual cutting units that tended toward spatial aggregation over time. Comparing the managed disturbance regimes with historical wild disturbance regimes can help us to understand the relative impact of management regimes on ecosystems.},

abstract = {Ecosystems driven by wildfire regimes are characterized by fire size distributions resembling power laws. Existing models produce power laws, but their predicted exponents are too high and fail to capture the exponent's variation with geographic region. Here we present a minimal model of fire dynamics that describes fire spread as a stochastic birth-death process, analogous to stochastic population growth or disease spread and incorporating memory effects from previous fires. The model reproduces multiple regional patterns in fire regimes and allows us to classify different regions in terms of their proximity to a critical threshold. Transitions across this critical threshold imply abrupt and pronounced increases in average fire size. The model predicts that large regions in Canada are currently close to this transition and might be driven beyond the threshold in the future. We illustrate this point by analyzing the time series for large fires (>199 ha) from the Canadian Boreal Plains, found to have shifted from a subcritical regime to a critical regime in the recent past. By contrast to its predecessor, the model also suggests that a critical transition, and not self-organized criticality, underlies forest fire dynamics, with implications for other ecological systems exhibiting power-law-like patterns, in particular for their sensitivity to environmental change and control efforts.},

Fuel management may prioritize removal of coarse woody debris (CWD) to minimize wildfire occur- rence, intensity, or both. Conversely, management for wildlife habitat or other ecological values often focuses retention of CWD. We modeled and quantified CWD use by red-backed voles (Clethrionomys gapperi), tested whether voles move selectively in portions of forest stands with greater CWD, and correlated stand-level measures of as habitat to fuel loads, providing a basis of comparison for CWD quantitative guidelines. Voles used CWD greater rate than expected based on availability and traveled in portions of stands with greater CWD coverage (21-27 trails made by individual voles in each of 5 forest stands). A strong correlation between stand-measure coverage and fuel-load measure (r = +0.96) provides a basis for comparing CWD guidelines. We concluded current guidelines from different research fields disagree. Only 2 of the 5 stands we sampled fit with guidelines fuel management and ectomycorrhizae in the northern Rocky Mountains. Coarse woody debris coverage in our stands was well below recommendations for small mammals in coastal forests.},

In addition, this information complements knowledge of wind speed, which allows researchers to draw some conclusions about the energy potential of wind and aids the development of efficient wind energy generation. This study focuses on modeling the frequency distribution of wind direction, including some characteristics of wind regime that cannot be represented by a unimodal distribution. To identify the most suitable model, a finite mixture of von Mises distributions were fitted to the average hourly wind direction data for nine wind stations located in Peninsular Malaysia. The data used were from the years 2000 to 2009. The suitability of each mixture distribution was judged based on the R2 coefficient and the histogram plot with a density line. The results showed that the finite mixture of the von Mises distribution with H number of components was the best distribution to describe the wind direction distributions in Malaysia. In addition, the circular density plots of the suitable model clearly showed the most prominent directions of wind blows than the other directions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The WUI is thus a focal area for human– environment conflicts, such as the destruction of homes by wildfires, habitat fragmentation, introduction of exotic species, and biodiversity decline. Our goal was to conduct a spatially detailed assessment of the WUI across the United States to provide a framework for scientific inquiries into housing growth effects on the environment and to inform both national policymakers and local land managers about the WUI and associated issues. The WUI in the conterminous United States covers 719 156 km2 (9% of land area) and contains 44.8 million housing units (39% of all houses). WUI areas are particularly widespread in the eastern United States, reaching a maximum of 72% of land area in Connecticut. California has the highest number of WUI housing units (5.1 million). The extent of the WUI highlights the need for ecological principles in land-use planning as well as sprawl-limiting policies to adequately address both wildfire threats and conservation problems.},

abstract = {We simulated fuel reduction treatments on a 16,000 ha study area in Oregon, US, to examine tradeoffs between placing fuel treatments near residential structures within an urban interface, versus treating stands in the adjacent wildlands to meet forest health and ecological restoration goals. The treatment strategies were evaluated by simulating 10,000 wildfires with random ignition locations and calculating burn probabilities by 0.5 m flame length categories for each 30 m ?? 30 m pixel in the study area. The burn conditions for the wildfires were chosen to replicate severe fire events based on 97th percentile historic weather conditions. The burn probabilities were used to calculate wildfire risk profiles for each of the 170 residential structures within the urban interface, and to estimate the expected (probabilistic) wildfire mortality of large trees (>53.3 cm) that are a key indicator of stand restoration objectives. Expected wildfire mortality for large trees was calculated by building flame length mortality functions using the Forest Vegetation Simulator, and subsequently applying these functions to the burn probability outputs. Results suggested that treatments on a relatively minor percentage of the landscape (10%) resulted in a roughly 70% reduction in the expected wildfire loss of large trees for the restoration scenario. Treating stands near residential structures resulted in a higher expected loss of large trees, but relatively lower burn probability and flame length within structure buffers. Substantial reduction in burn probability and flame length around structures was also observed in the restoration scenario where fuel treatments were located 5-10 km distant. These findings quantify off-site fuel treatment effects that are not analyzed in previous landscape fuel management studies. The study highlights tradeoffs between ecological management objectives on wildlands and the protection of residential structures in the urban interface. We also advance the application of quantitative risk analysis to the problem of wildfire threat assessment.},

abstract = {Climate, topography, fuel loadings, and human activities all affect spatial and temporal patterns of fire occurrence. Because fire is modeled as a stochastic process, for which each fire history is only one realization, a simulation approach is necessary to understand baseline variability, thereby identifying constraints, or forcing functions, that affect fire regimes. With a suitable neutral model, characteristics of natural fire regimes estimated from fire history data can be compared to a ‘‘null hypothesis''. We generated random landscapes of fire-scarred trees via a point process with sequential spatial inhibition. Random ignition points, fire sizes, and fire years were drawn from uniform and exponential family probability distributions. We compared two characteristics of neutral fire regimes to those from five watersheds in eastern Washington that have experienced low-severity fire. Composite fire intervals (CFIs) at multiple spatial scales displayed similar monotonic decreases with increasing sample area in neutral vs. real landscapes, although patterns of residuals from statistical models differed. In contrast, parameters of theWeibull distribution associated with temporal trends in fire hazard exhibited different forms of scale dependence in real vs. simulated data. Clear patterns in neutral landscapes suggest that deviations from them in empirical data represent real constraints on fire regimes (e.g., topography, fuels). As with any null model, however, neutral fire-regime models need to be carefully tuned to avoid confounding these constraints with artifacts of modeling. Neutral models show promise for investigating low-severity fire regimes to separate intrinsic properties of stochastic processes from the effects of climate, fuel loadings, topography, and management.},

abstract = {Vegetation patterns at the landscape scale are shaped by myriad\nprocesses and historical events, and understanding the relative\nimportance of these processes aids in predicting current and future\nplant distributions. To quantify the influence of different\nenvironmental and anthropogenic patterns on observed vegetation\npatterns, we used simultaneous autoregressive modeling to analyze data\ncollected by the Carnegie Airborne Observatory over Santa Cruz Island\n(SCI; California, USA). SCI is a large continental island, and its\nlimited suite of species and well documented land use history allowed us\nto consider many potential determinants of vegetation patterns, such as\ntopography, substrate, and historical grazing intensity. As a metric of\nvegetation heterogeneity, we used the normalized difference vegetation\nindex (NDVI) stratified into three vegetation height classes using LiDAR\n(short, medium, and tall). In the SAR models topography and substrate\ntype were important controls, together explaining 8-15 % of the total\nvariation in NDVI, but historical grazing and spatial autocorrelation\nwere also key components of the models, together explaining 17-21 % of\nthe variation in NDVI. Optimal spatial autocorrelation distances in the\nshort and medium height vegetation models (600-700 m) were similar to\nthe home range sizes of two crucial seed dispersers on the island-the\nisland fox (Urocyon littoralis santacruzae) and the island scrub-jay\n(Aphelocoma insularis)-suggesting that these animals may be important\ndrivers of the island's vegetation patterns. This study highlights the\nimportance of dynamic processes like dispersal limitation and\ndisturbance history in determining present-day vegetation patterns.},

abstract = {Recent research documents that the widely accepted generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) method for describing forecasting precision and the impact of parameter uncertainty in rainfall/runoff watershed models fails to achieve the intended purpose when used with an informal likelihood measure. In particular, GLUE generally fails to produce intervals that capture the precision of estimated parameters, and the difference between predictions and future observations. This paper illustrates these problems with GLUE using a simple linear rainfall/runoff model so that model calibration is a linear regression problem for which exact expressions for prediction precision and parameter uncertainty are well known and understood. The simple regression example enables us to clearly and simply illustrate GLUE deficiencies. Beven and others have suggested that the choice of the likelihood measure used in a GLUE computation is subjective and may be selected to reflect the goals of the modeler. If an arbitrary likelihood is adopted that does not reasonably reflect the sampling distribution of the model errors, then GLUE generates arbitrary results without statistical validity that should not be used in scientific work. The traditional subjective likelihood measures that have been used with GLUE also fail to reflect the nonnormality, heteroscedasticity, and serial correlation among the residual errors generally found in real problems, and hence are poor metrics for even simple sensitivity analyses and model calibration. Most previous applications of GLUE only produce uncertainty intervals for the average model prediction, which by construction should not be expected to include future observations with the prescribed probability. We show how the GLUE methodology when properly implemented with a statistically valid likelihood function can provide prediction intervals for future observations which will agree with widely accepted and statistically valid analyses.},

abstract = {The overall effects of the fire on ecosystems are complex, ranging from the reduction or elimination of aboveground biomass to impacts on belowground physical, chemical and microbial mediated processes. Since a key component of overall ecosystem sustainability occurs belowground, recovery is tied to the soil's physical, chemical, and biological functions and processes. Depending on several fire severity measures, changes in belowground components can be either beneficial or deleterious to the entire ecosystem. Low-impact burning can promote a herbaceous flora, increase plant available nutrients, and thin overcrowded forests, all of which can foster healthy systems. Severe fires can often cause changes in successional rates, alter above- and belowground species composition, generate volatilization of nutrients and ash entrainment in smoke columns produce rapid or decreased mineralization rates, alter C:N ratios, and result in subsequent nutrient losses through accelerated erosion, leaching or denitrification. In addition, changes in soil hydrologic functioning, degradation of soil physical properties, decreases in micro- and macrofauna, and alterations in microbial populations and associated processes can occur. The direct effect of fire on belowground systems, is a result of the burning severity, which integrates aboveground fuel loading (live and dead), soil moisture and subsequent soil temperatures, and duration of the burn. The time for recovery of belowground systems will not only depend on the burning intensity and its effect on key ecosystem processes and components, but also on the previous land-use practices. Thus, the impacts of fire on belowground systems can be highly variable and may not be predictable. Our paper is a general review of the effects of fire on belowground systems with emphasis placed on the changes in physical, biogeochemical and biological properties of soils and the resulting consequences these changes have for ecosystem sustainability.},

Multicriteria evaluation offers the methodological and mathematical tools to operationalize the concept of incommensurability at both macro and micro levels of analysis. The concept of incommensurability of values already has a long tradition in economics; moreover, we will showt that analytic philosophy, theories of complexity, post-normal science and the recent theories of rationality lead with different trajectories to a non-algorithmic approach which, in our view, could be implemented by some forms of multicriteria evaluation.},

The management problems are formulated for a mixed-conifer stand and approximations of the optimal solutions are obtained using simulation optimization. The Northern Idaho variant of the Forest Vegetation Simulator and its Fire and Fuels Extension is used to predict stand growth and fire effects. Interest rate and fire risk are found to be critical determinants of the superior stand management system and timber supply. Uneven-aged management is superior with higher interest rates with or without fire risk. Alterations in the interest rate affect optimal stocking levels of uneven-aged stands, but have only minor effects on the long-run timber supply. Higher interest rates reduce rotation length and regeneration investments of even-aged stands, which lead to markedly reduced timber supply. Increasing fire risk increases the relative efficiency of even-aged management because a single age cohort is less susceptible to fire damage over the course of the rotation than multiple cohorts in uneven-aged stands. Higher fire risk reduces optimal diameter limit under uneven-aged management and decreases optimal rotation length and planting density under even-aged management.},

Controlling road-related erosion therefore remains an important issue for forest stewardship. Managers are faced with the task to develop efficient road management strategies to achieve conflicting environmental and economic goals. This manuscript uses mathematical programming techniques to identify the efficient frontier between sediment reduction and treatment costs. Information on the nature of the tradeoffs between conflicting objectives can give the decision maker more insight into the problem, and help in reaching a suitable compromise solution. This approach avoids difficulties associated with a priori establishment of targets for sediment reduction, preferences between competing objectives, and mechanisms to scale noncommensurate objectives. Computational results demonstrate the utility of this multiobjective optimization approach, which should facilitate tradeoff analysis and ideally promote efficient erosion control on forest roads.},

The minimum light required for survival, shade tolerance, is a crucial life-history trait that plays a major role in plant community dynamics. There is consensus on the suites of traits that influence shade tolerance, but debate over the relative importance of traits maximizing photosynthetic carbon gain in low light versus those minimizing losses. Shade tolerance is influenced by plant ontogeny and by numerous biotic and abiotic factors. Although phenotypic plasticity tends to be low in shade-tolerant species (e.g., scant elongation in low light), plasticity for certain traits, particularly for morphological features optimizing light capture, can be high. Understanding differential competitive potentials among co-occurring species mediated by shade tolerance is critical to predict ecosystem responses to global change drivers such as elevated CO(2), climate change and the spread of invasive species.},

abstract = {1. Ecologists are obtaining ever-increasing amounts of data concerning animal movement. A movement strategy that has been concluded for a broad variety of animals is that of L{\'{e}}vy flights, which are random walks whose step lengths come from probability distributions with heavy power-law tails. 2. The exponent that parameterizes the power-law tail, denoted micro, has repeatedly been found to be within the L{\'{e}}vy range of 1 < micro <or= 3. Here, we use Monte Carlo simulations to show that the methods used to infer the value of micro are inaccurate. 3. The widely used method of simply logarithmically transforming a standard histogram of movement lengths has been shown elsewhere to be problematic. Here, we further demonstrate how poor it is, and show that it actually biases estimates of micro towards the L{\'{e}}vy range of 1 < micro <or= 3, and can bias estimates towards the value of micro = 2. Thus, previous reports of animals undergoing L{\'{e}}vy flights, or of micro being close to the reported optimal value of micro = 2, may simply be a consequence of the bias generated by this method. 4. A technique that has been recently recommended is to logarithmically bin the data and then normalize the resulting histogram. We show that this technique also produces biased results, and suffers from similar problems as those just outlined, although to a lesser extent. 5. The proposed solution is to use likelihood. We find that calculating the maximum likelihood estimate of micro gives the most accurate results (having also tested the rank/frequency method). Likelihood has the further advantages of being the easiest method to implement, and of yielding accurate confidence intervals. Results are applicable to power-law distributions in general, and so are not restricted to inference of L{\'{e}}vy flights. 6. We also re-analyse a data set of grey seal movements that was originally reported to demonstrate L{\'{e}}vy flight behaviour. Using Akaike weights, we test four models, and find no evidence for L{\'{e}}vy flights. Overall, our results suggest that L{\'{e}}vy flights might not be as common as previously thought.},

Often, mathematical models contain simplifying idealizations designed to cope with the blooming, buzzing confusion of the natural world. This strategy frequently issues in models whose predictions are inaccurate. Critics of theoretical ecology argue that only predictively accurate models are successful and contribute to the applied work of conservation biologists. Hence, they think that much of the mathematical work of ecologists is poor science. Against this view, I argue that model building is successful even when models are predictively inaccurate for at least three reasons: models allow scientists to explore the possible behaviors of ecological systems; models give scientists simplified means by which they can investigate more complex systems by determining how the more complex system deviates from the simpler model; and models give scientists conceptual frameworks through which they can conduct experiments and fieldwork. Critics often mistake the purposes of model building, and once we recognize this, we can see their complaints are unjustified. Even though models in ecology are not always accurate in their assumptions and predictions, they still contribute to successful science.},

abstract = {Abstract Questions: 1. Does flood pulsing drive metacommunity dynamics and provide insurance against catastrophic flooding in desert southwestern riparian ecosystems? 2. Do upland and wetland species in the floodplain differ in their dynamics? Location: Southwestern USA. Methods: We sampled vegetation and propagule banks in four communities along a floodplain hydrogradient. Plant species were classified as wetland or upland and community wetland indicator scores were calculated. ANOVA tested for differences between data categories amongst communities (extant vegetation and propagule banks) and soil depths. S{\o}rensen's similarity coefficient was calculated to determine compositional similarity between vegetation and propagule banks. Results: Community propagule banks had high similarity indicating broad dispersal by flood waters. Wetland propagules were present in soils from channel bars to floodplain edges, despite declines in wetland vegetation with distance from channel. Wetland communities in propagule banks were dissimilar from those in vegetation except on channel bars. Upland species (vegetation and propagule banks) increased with distance from channel. Propagules of upland species were most abundant in the litter, and were compositionally similar to upland species in most communities. Conclusions: Flood pulsing is one mechanism that drives spatiotemporal metacommunity dynamics in dynamic desert riparian ecosystems. The homogenized regional propagule bank created by flood pulsing provides wetland species with a mechanism to escape local extinction by allowing for recolonization after flooding creates suitable establishment conditions. Upland species are able to germinate from in-situ sources after small-scale flooding or rainfall moistens soil. In fluctuating environments, these dynamics sustain biodiversity in the face of ongoing environmental change.},

abstract = {This study investigated whether the regional hydro-ecological simulation system RHESSys is a suitable tool for long-term global change impact studies under selected climatic conditions of Europe, taking advantage of the strongly varying climate along elevational gradients in mountain regions. We performed a validation of RHESSys using daily, monthly and yearly data on (1) streamflow and snow cover in five Alpine catchments and (2) water and carbon fluxes at 15 EUROFLUX sites. The simulation results generally agreed well with observations. RHESSys reasonably reproduced daily and monthly streamflow, as well as the seasonal cycle and amplitude of typical Alpine discharge regimes. Furthermore, RHESSys was capable of capturing the key features of the carbon cycle of various forested ecosystems, including significant differences between managed and close-to-natural forests, and more subtle distinctions between coniferous and deciduous systems. Our analyses confirmed that RHESSys is a suitable tool for studying global change impacts on mountain hydrology. Regarding the simulation of the carbon cycle, this investigation detected some data and model limitations that are discussed in detail. Finally, suggestions for model improvements are made, mainly concerning the formulations of decomposition and respiration rates in biogeochemical models. Copyright},

abstract = {Cross-scale spatial and temporal perspectives are important for studying contagious landscape disturbances such as fire, which are controlled by myriad processes operating at different scales. We examine fire regimes in forests of western North America, focusing on how observed patterns of fire frequency change across spatial scales. To quantify changes in fire frequency across spatial scale, we derive the event-area (EA) relationship and the analogous interval-area (IA) relationship using historical and simulated data from low- and highseverity fire regimes. The EA and IA provide multiscale descriptions of fire regimes, as opposed to standard metrics that may apply only at a single scale. Parameters and properties of scaling functions (intercept, slope, minimum value) are associated statistically with properties of the fire regime, such as mean fire-free intervals and fire size distributions, but are not direct mathematical transformations of them because they also reflect mechanistic drivers of fire that are non-stationary in time and space. Patterns in fire-scaling relations can be used to identify how controls on fire regimes change across spatial and temporal scales. Future research that considers fire as a cross-scale process will be directly applicable to landscape-scale fire management.},

abstract = {Many multiple criteria decision making methods have been proposed and
applied to water planning. Their purpose is to provide information on
tradeoffs among objectives and to help users articulate value judgments
in a systematic, coherent, and documentable manner. The wide variety
of available techniques confuses potential users, causing inappropriate
matching of methods with problems. Experiments in which water planners
apply more than one multicriteria procedure to realistic problems can
help dispel this confusion by testing method appropriateness, ease of
use, and validity. We summarize one such experiment where U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers personnel used several methods to screen urban water
supply plans. The methods evaluated include goal programming, ELECTRE
I, additive value functions, multiplicative utility functions, and
three techniques for choosing weights (direct rating, indifference
tradeoff, and the analytical hierarchy process). Among the conclusions
we reach are the following. First, experienced planners generally
prefer simpler, more transparent methods. Additive value functions are
favored. Yet none of the methods are endorsed by a majority of the
participants; many preferred to use no formal method at all. Second,
there is strong evidence that rating, the most commonly applied weight
selection method, is likely to lead to weights that fail to represent
the trade-offs that users are willing to make among criteria. Finally,
we show that decisions can be as or more sensitive to the method used
as to which person applies it. Therefore, if who chooses is important,
then so too is how a choice is made.},

abstract = {We used vegetation data collected in areas before they were burned by the 2500 ha Quartz fire in southern Oregon and the 50 600 ha Big Bar complex in northern California to evaluate the ability of vegetation and topographic characteristics to predict patterns of fire severity. Fire severity was characterized as high, moderate, or low based on crown scorch and consumption, and changes in soil structure. In both fires, vegetation plots with southern aspects were more likely to burn with high severity than plots with eastern, northern, or western aspects. This was the only consistent predictor across both fires. In the Quartz fire, we found that plots at higher elevations and with larger diameter trees were more likely to burn with low or moderate severity. These correlations may have been influenced in part by the effects of unmeasured weather conditions. We found few strong correlates in the Big Bar complex, owing in part to the fact that most (75%) of our plots were in the low-severity category, providing relatively little variation. These results, in combination with previous studies of fire severity in the Klamath-Siskiyou region, suggest that areas with southern aspects tend to burn with greater severity than those of other aspects, areas with large trees burn less severely than those with smaller trees, and that correlates of fire severity vary extensively among fires.},

abstract = {We describe a spatially explicit simulation model of large-scale forest
cover transition in the North American boreal biome. This model is a
time-dependent Markov chain with discrete states corresponding to
dominant tree species in the forest canopy. To parameterize the model,
we used three temporal variables, extracted from published data from
field studies: period of persistence of a given cover type, the time
interval of forest cover replacement by another, and the time of
complete replacement. Environmental domains based on climate, soil
moisture regime, and soil nutrient status stratified all forest cover
transitions. Probability matrices of forest cover transition were
derived for 15 discrete states at 20-year intervals for each of the
environmental domains. Five spatial databases from boreal North America
were used as input to the model: forest cover composition, time since
last forest cover change, climate zone, soil moisture regime, and soil
nutrient status. The model output consists of spatially explicit
prediction of (a) time since last disturbance, (b) transition age, (c)
forest cover composition, and (d) canopy age in 20-year time steps at I
ha resolution. As a case study, we simulated forest cover transition in
a 3.7 million ha area in boreal Canada. These 200-year simulations show
that spatio-temporal transition of forest cover type is significant even

abstract = {Here, we present the second part of a quantitative theory for the structure and dynamics of forests under demographic and resource steady state. The theory is based on individual-level allometric scaling relations for how trees use resources, fill space, and grow. These scale up to determine emergent properties of diverse forests, including size-frequency distributions, spacing relations, canopy configurations, mortality rates, population dynamics, successional dynamics, and resource flux rates. The theory uniquely makes quantitative predictions for both stand-level scaling exponents and normalizations. We evaluate these predictions by compiling and analyzing macroecological datasets from several tropical forests. The close match between theoretical predictions and data suggests that forests are organized by a set of very general scaling rules. Our mechanistic theory is based on allometric scaling relations, is complementary to "demographic theory," but is fundamentally different in approach. It provides a quantitative baseline for understanding deviations from predictions due to other factors, including disturbance, variation in branching architecture, asymmetric competition, resource limitation, and other sources of mortality, which are not included in the deliberately simplified theory. The theory should apply to a wide range of forests despite large differences in abiotic environment, species diversity, and taxonomic and functional composition.},

horizon for short-term reservoir operation. The modelling procedure
includes: (1) an adaptive forecasting algorithm; (2) a real-time
reservoir operation model; (3) a multiobjective compromise programming
algorithm. The compromise programming algorithm utilizes a
multiobjective compromise between the conflicting objectives of
hydrologic forecast reliability and reservoir operation penalties. The
algorithm requires predetermined weights defining the relative
importance of the two objectives. This paper presents a risk-based
methodology developed to help a decision maker in selecting the
appropriate weights. Reliability, vulnerability, and resiliency are
used as three risk-based criteria for assisting in selection of the
weights. The methodology is presented in the form of a rule-based
system designed to aid the user in the selection process. The
methodology is illustrated through an application of the technique to
the operation of Green Reservoir in Kentucky. The reservoir model is
implemented for four different historical periods and its performance
in terms of total penalties, reliability, vulnerability, and resiliency
is presented as a function of the multi-objective weighting parameters.
The rule-based expert system is then used for deriving recommendations
regarding the selection of appropriate weights. The paper also

abstract = {Quantitative fire risk analysis depends on characterizing and combining fire behavior probabilities and effects. Fire behavior probabilities are different from fire occurrence statistics (historic numbers or probabilities of discovered ignitions) because they depend on spatial and temporal factors controlling fire growth. That is, the likelihood of fire burning a specific area is dependent on ignitions occurring off-site and the fuels, topography, weather, and relative fire direction allowing each fire to reach that location. Research is required to compare computational short-cuts that have been proposed for approximating these fire behavior distributions. Fire effects in a risk analysis must also be evaluated on a common scale for the variety of values susceptible to wildland fire. This means that appraisals of fire impacts to human infrastructure and ecological values must be measured by the same currency so that the risk assessment yields a single expectation of fire effects. Ultimately, this will help guide planning and investment into management activities that can alter either the probabilities of damaging fire or the susceptibility to those fire behaviors.},

abstract = {We used the Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FFE-FVS) to simulate fuel treatment effects on 45 162 stands in low- to midelevation dry forests (e.g., ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex. P. & C. Laws.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) of the western United States. We evaluated treatment effects on predicted post-treatment fire behavior (fire type) and fire hazard (torching index). FFE-FVS predicts that thinning and surface fuel treatments reduced crown fire behavior relative to no treatment; a large proportion of stands were predicted to transition from active crown fire pre-treatment to surface fire post-treatment. Intense thinning treatments (125 and 250 residual trees{\textperiodcentered}ha–1) were predicted to be more effective than light thinning treatments (500 and 750 residual trees{\textperiodcentered}ha–1). Prescribed fire was predicted to be the most effective surface fuel treatment, whereas FFE-FVS predicted no difference between no surface fuel treatment and extraction of fuels. This inability to discriminate the effects of certain fuel treatments illuminates the consequence of a documented limitation in how FFE-FVS incorporates fuel models and we suggest improvements. The concurrence of results from modeling and empirical studies provides quantitative support for “fire-safe” principles of forest fuel reduction (sensu Agee and Skinner 2005. For. Ecol. Manag. 211: 83–96).},

abstract = {The United Nations climate treaty may soon include a mechanism for
compensating tropical nations that succeed in reducing carbon emissions
from deforestation and forest degradation, source of nearly one fifth
of global carbon emissions. We review the potential for this mechanism
{[}reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD)] to
provoke ecological damages and promote ecological cobenefits. Nations
could potentially participate in REDD by slowing clear-cutting of
mature tropical forest, slowing or decreasing the impact of selective
logging, promoting forest regeneration and restoration, and expanding
tree plantations. REDD could also foster efforts to reduce the
incidence of forest fire. Potential ecological costs include the
accelerated loss (through displaced agricultural expansion) of
low-biomass, high-conservation-value ecosystems, and substitution of
low-biomass vegetation by monoculture tree plantations. These costs
could be avoided through measures that protect low-biomass native
ecosystems. Substantial ecological cobenefits should be conferred under
most circumstances, and include the maintenance or restoration of (1)
watershed functions, (2) local and regional climate regimes, (3) soils
and biogeochemical processes, (4) water quality and aquatic habitat,
and (5) terrestrial habitat. Some tools already being developed to
monitor, report and verify (MRV) carbon emissions performance can also
be used to measure other elements of ecosystem function, making
development of MRV systems for ecological cobenefits a concrete
possibility. Analysis of possible REDD program interventions in a
large-scale Amazon landscape indicates that even modest flows of forest
carbon funding can provide substantial cobenefits for aquatic
ecosystems, but that the functional integrity of the landscape's myriad
small watersheds would be best protected under a more even spatial
distribution of forests. Because of its focus on an ecosystem service
with global benefits, REDD could access a large pool of global
stakeholders willing to pay to maintain carbon in forests, thereby
providing a potential cascade of ecosystem services to local
stakeholders who would otherwise be unable to afford them.},

Linking fire spread patterns to synoptic-scale weather situations are a promising approach to simulating fire spread without finegrained weather data. Here we present MedSpreadda model that evaluates the weights of five landscape factors in fire spread performance. We readjusted the factor weights for convective, topographydriven and wind-driven fires (n ¼ 123) and re-assessed each fire spread group's performance against seven other control simulations. Results show that for each of the three fire spread patterns, some landscape factors exert a higher influence on fire spread simulation than others. We also found strong evidence that separating fires by fire spread pattern improves model performances. This study shows a promising link between relevant fire weather information, fire spread and fire regime simulation under global change processes.},

Because it is unclear what should be included in modeling papers, or reviews of modeling papers, there are no standards as to what constitutes a rigorous evaluation of this type of scientific effort. The result is a wide range in the quality and completeness of modeling papers, and a reduction of the impact of modeling as a tool for research in ecology and ecosystem studies. Models can be the most accessible and transferable form of ecological information. The actual code that produces the dynamics of the model is a quantitative and unambiguous expression of how the results were obtained. Any researcher running the model with the same inputs should obtain the same outputs. However, this form of communication is open only if the actual code of a model is available to other research groups.

Simulation studies that use certain fire modelling systems (i.e. NEXUS, FlamMap, FARSITE, FFE-FVS (Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator), Fuel Manage- ment Analyst (FMAPlus), BehavePlus) based on separate implementations or direct integration of Rothermel's surface and crown rate of fire spread models with Van Wagner's crown fire transition and propagation models are shown to have a significant underprediction bias when used in assessing potential crown fire behaviour in conifer forests of western North America. The principal sources of this underprediction bias are shown to include: (i) incompatible model linkages; (ii) use of surface and crown fire rate of spread models that have an inherent underprediction bias; and (iii) reduction in crown fire rate of spread based on the use of unsubstantiated crown fraction burned functions. The use of uncalibrated custom fuel models to represent surface fuelbeds is a fourth potential source of bias. These sources are described and documented in detail based on comparisons with experimental fire and wildfire observations and on separate analyses of model components. The manner in which the two primary canopy fuel inputs influencing crown fire initiation (i.e. foliar moisture content and canopy base height) is handled in these simulation studies and the meaning of Scott and Reinhardt's two crown fire hazard indices are also critically examined.},

While the concept was formally introduced a little more than 10 years ago, the underpinning of the concept can be traced back to more than a century to the early work of Darwin. The formal application of the idea is yielding new insights into the role of species in ecosystems and many other areas of basic and applied ecology. Here we focus on how temporal, spatial and organizational scales usefully inform the roles played by ecosystem engineers and their incorporation into broader ecological contexts. Two particular, distinguishing features of ecosystem engineers are that they affect the physical space in which other species live and their direct effects can last longer than the lifetime of the organism--engineering can in essence outlive the engineer. Together, these factors identify critical considerations that need to be included in models, experimental and observational work. The ecosystem engineering concept holds particular promise in the area of ecological applications, where influence over abiotic variables and their consequent effects on biotic communities may facilitate ecological restoration and counterbalance anthropogenic influences.},

At this transition, patchiness develops which lacks a characteristic or dominant spatial scale. Thus, criticality lies at the interface of two important subjects in ecology, threshold behavior and patchiness. Most ecological examples of criticality involve processes of disturbance and recovery; the spatial and temporal scales of these processes enable three different types of critical system to be distinguished: classical phase transitions, self organized criticality (SOC) and 'robust' criticality. Here, we review the properties defining these three types and their implications for threshold behavior and large intermittent temporal fluctuations, with examples taken from spatial stochastic models for predator-prey, infected-susceptible, and disturbance-recovery interactions. In critical systems, spatial properties of patchiness alone are insufficient indicators of impending sudden changes, unless complemented by the spatial and temporal scales of disturbance and recovery themselves.},

We used three sampling designs (random, systematic grids, and stratified). We assessed the sensitivity of estimates of Weibull median probability fire intervals (WMPI) to sampling design and to factors that degrade the fire scar record: failure of a tree to record a fire and loss of fire-scarred trees. Accuracy was affected by all of the factors investigated and generally varied with fire regime type. The maximum error was from degradation of the record, primarily because degradation reduced the number of intervals from which WMPI was estimated. The sampling designs were roughly equal in their ability to capture overall WMPI, regardless of fire regime, but the gridded design yielded more accurate estimates of spatial variation in WMPI. Accuracy in WMPI increased with increasing number of points sampled for all fire regimes and sampling designs, but the number of points needed to obtain accurate estimates was greater for fire regimes with complex spatial patterns of fire intervals than for those with relatively homogeneous patterns},

abstract = {Prior to Euro–American settlement, dry ponderosa pine and mixed conifer forests (hereafter, the ‘‘dry forests'') of the Inland Northwest were burned by frequent low- or mixed-severity fires. These mostly surface fires maintained low and variable tree densities, light and patchy ground fuels, simplified forest structure, and favored fire-tolerant trees, such as ponderosa pine, and a low and patchy cover of associated fire-tolerant shrubs and herbs. Low- and mixed-severity fires provided other important feedbacks and effects to ponderosa pine-dominated stands and landscapes. For example, in stands, frequent surface fires favored an ongoing yet piecemeal regeneration of fire-tolerant trees by periodically exposing patches of mineral soil. They maintained fire-tolerant forest structures by elevating tree crown bases and scorching or consuming many seedlings, saplings, and pole-sized trees. They cycled nutrients from branches and foliage to the soil, where they could be used by other plants, and promoted the growth and development of low and patchy understory shrub and herb vegetation. Finally, surface fires reduced the long-term threat of running crown fires by reducing the fuel bed and metering out individual tree and group torching, and they reduced competition for site resources among surviving trees, shrubs, and herbs. In landscapes, the patterns of dry forest structure and composition that resulted from frequent fires reinforced the occurrence of low- or mixed-severity fires, because frequent burning spatially isolated conditions that supported high-severity fires. These spatial patterns reduced the likelihood of severe fire behavior and effects at each episode of fire. Rarely, dry forest landscapes were affected by more severe climate-driven events. Extant dry forests no longer appear or function as they once did. Large landscapes are homogeneous in their composition and structure, and the regional landscape is set up for severe, large fire and insect disturbance events. Among ecologists, there is also a high degree of concern about how future dry forests will develop, if fires continue to be large and severe. In this paper, we describe the key landscape pattern and process changes wrought by the sum of the settlement and management influences to date, and we point to an uncertain future for ecosystem management. Widespread selection cutting of the largest and oldest ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir in the 20th century has reduced much of the economic opportunity that might have been associated with restoration, and long-term investment will likely be needed, if large-scale restoration activities are attempted. Anuncertain future for ecosystem management is based on the lack of current and improbable future social consensus concerning desired outcomes for public forestlands, the need for significant financial investment in ecosystem restoration, a lack of integrated planning and decision tools, and mismatches between the existing planning process, Congressional appropriations, and complex management and restoration problems},

abstract = {Understanding the influences of forest management practices on wildfire severity is critical in fire-prone ecosystems of the western United States. Newly available geospatial data sets characterizing vegetation, fuels, topography, and burn severity offer new opportunities for studying fuel treatment effectiveness at regional to national scales. In this study, we used ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression and sequential autoregression (SAR) to analyze fuel treatment effects on burn severity for three recent wildfires: the Camp 32 fire in western Montana, the School fire in southeastern Washington, and the Warm fire in northern Arizona. Burn severity was measured using differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) maps developed by the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity project. Geospatial data sets from the LANDFIRE project were used to control for prefire variability in canopy cover, fuels, and topography. Across all three fires, treatments that incorporated prescribed burning were more effective than thinning alone. Treatment effect sizes were lower, and standard errors were higher in the SAR models than in the OLS models. Spatial error terms in the SAR models indirectly controlled for confounding variables not captured in the LANDFIRE data, including spatiotemporal variability in fire weather and landscape-level effects of reduced fire severity outside the treated areas. This research demonstrates the feasibility of carrying out assessments of fuel treatment effectiveness using geospatial data sets and highlights the potential for using spatial autoregression to control for unmeasured confounding factors.},

HOT is motivated primarily by systems from biology and engineering and emphasizes, (i) highly structured, nongeneric, self-dissimilar internal configurations, and (ii) robust yet fragile external behavior. HOT claims these are the most important features of complexity and not accidents of evolution or artifices of engineering design but are inevitably intertwined and mutually reinforcing. In the spirit of this collection, our paper contrasts HOT with alternative perspectives on complexity, drawing on real-world examples and also model systems, particularly those from self-organized criticality.},

abstract = {Removal of dead and live biomass from forested stands affects subsequent fuel dynamics and fire potential. The amount of material left onsite after biomass removal operations can influence the intensity and severity of subsequent unplanned wildfires or prescribed burns. We developed a set of biomass removal treatment scenarios and simulated their effects on a number of stands that represent two major forests types of the northern Rocky Mountains: lodgepole and ponderosa pine. The Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator was used to simulate effects including stand development, fire behavior, and fire effects prior to the biomass removal treatment and 1, 10, 30, and 60 years after the treatment. Analysis of variance was used to determine whether these changes in fuel dynamics and fire potential differed significantly from each other. Results indicated that fire and fuel characteristics varied within and between forest types and depended on the nature of the treatment, as well as time since treatment. Biomass removal decreased fire potential in the short term, but results were mixed over the long term.},

abstract = {In conservation biology, uncertainty about the choice of a statistical model is rarely considered. Model-selection uncertainty occurs whenever one model is chosen over plausible alternative models to represent understanding about a process and to make predictions about future observations. The standard approach to representing prediction uncertainty involves the calculation of prediction (or confidence) intervals that incor- porate uncertainty about parameter estimates contingent on the choice of a “best” model chosen to represent truth. However, this approach to prediction based on statistical models tends to ignore model-selection uncer- tainty, resulting in overconfident predictions. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) has been promoted in a range of disciplines as a simple means of incorporating model-selection uncertainty into statistical inference and pre- diction. Bayesian model averaging also provides a formal framework for incorporating prior knowledge about the process being modeled. We provide an example of the application of BMA in modeling and predicting the spatial distribution of an arboreal marsupial in the Eden region of southeastern Australia. Other approaches to estimating prediction uncertainty are discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract  Ecosystems driven by wildfire regimes are characterized by fire size distributions resembling power laws. Existing models produce power laws, but their predicted exponents are too high and fail to capture the exponent's variation with geographic region. Here we present a minimal model of fire dynamics that describes fire spread as a stochastic birth-death process, analogous to stochastic population growth or disease spread and incorporating memory effects from previous fires. The model reproduces multiple regional patterns in fire regimes and allows us to classify different regions in terms of their proximity to a critical threshold. Transitions across this critical threshold imply abrupt and pronounced increases in average fire size. The model predicts that large regions in Canada are currently close to this transition and might be driven beyond the threshold in the future. We illustrate this point by analyzing the time series for large fires (>199 ha) from the Canadian Boreal Plains, found to have shifted from a subcritical regime to a critical regime in the recent past. By contrast to its predecessor, the model also suggests that a critical transition, and not self-organized criticality, underlies forest fire dynamics, with implications for other ecological systems exhibiting power-law-like patterns, in particular for their sensitivity to environmental change and control efforts.},
annote = {First reaction--creative take on SOC, similar in idea to what we&#039;re saying.  Contagion and ecosystem-specific effects on contagion are important for fire dynamics, regimes, and patterns.  

        
I think the regrowth as in SOC might be a problem, and I don&#039;t think they are able to distinguish the ecoregions in their differences in regrowth (or at least if they do, they don&#039;t present or talk about it).  It&#039;s all subsumed in the spread probability, so no clear separation in the effects of the parameters (they&#039;re convoluted).  Actually, in table 2 there is a clear and undiscussed relationship between spread probablity and fire frequency.  as spread probability increases (transitions from "sub-critical" to "critical"), the theta parameter decreases (higher theta is associated with lower f, which means less frequent fire--so higher spread probability is associated with more frequent fire?).  This has to be unraveled before we can really say anything about the phase transition.  It&#039;s the combination of parameters that are clearly important

        
They acknowledge that the spread probability needs to be unraveled, but it didn&#039;t seem like that would be outside of the scope of the paper.  If we know something of the topography and climate of the ecoregions, can&#039;t we speculate?

        
Methodologically, they use a maximum MLE to a multinomial?!  At least it should be ordered...and other statistics would probably have been better.  Just because it maximizes the MLE doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s a good fit, it&#039;s just the best among the possibilities.  The pattern in the parameters is compelling maybe, but without a discussion of why the ecology matches the model it&#039;s not particularly convincing.   A GOF that characterizes spread of parameters indisinguishable from observed (revealing my bias) would have been a useful characterization of uncertainty.  Chisq?  KS?  Multinomial is really brute force, and loses df pretty quick.  Lots of data lost, why not estimate ecdf?

        
From our perspective, we still don&#039;t have a good answer until we can replicate fire size distributions simultaneously with the SD variogram.},

More specifically, an accurate knowledge of the spatial distribution of fuels is critical when analyzing, modelling and predicting fire behaviour.

Second, we summarize the main techniques employed to map fuel types starting with the most traditional approaches, such as field work, aerial photo interpretation or ecological modelling. We pay special attention to more contemporary techniques, which involve the use of remote sensing systems. In general, remote sensing systems are low-priced, can be regularly updated and are less time-consuming than traditional methods, but they are still facing important limitations. Recent work has shown that the integration of different sources of information and methods in a complementary way helps to overcome most of these limitations.

abstract = {Raster-based spatial land cover transition models (LCTMs) are widely
used in landscape ecology. However, many LCTMs do not account for
spatial dependence of the input data, which may artificially fragment
the output spatial configuration. We demonstrate the consequences of
ignoring spatial dependence, thus assigning probabilities randomly in
space, using a simple LCTM. We ran the model from four different initial
conditions with distinct spatial configurations and results indicated
that, after 20 simulation steps, all of them converged towards the
spatial configuration of the random data set. From an ecological
perspective this is a serious problem because ecological data often
exhibit distinct spatial configuration related to ecological processes.
As a solution, we propose an approach (region approach) that accounts
for spatial dependence of LCTM input data. Underlying spatial dependence
was used to apply spatial bias to probability assignment within the
model. As a case study we applied a region approach to a Vegetation
Transition Model (VTM); a semi-Markovian model that simulates forest
succession. The VTM was applied to approximately 500,000 ha of boreal
forest in Ontario, at 1 ha pixel resolution. When the stochastic
transition algorithms were applied without accounting for spatial
dependence, spatial configuration of the output data became
progressively more fragmented. When the VTM was applied using the region
approach to account for spatial dependence output fragmentation was
reduced. Accounting for spatial dependence in transition models will
create more reliable output for analyzing spatial patterns and relating
those patterns to ecological processes.},

abstract = {Six models were devised for a hypothetical predator-prey system. The models differed in functional forms, but were calibrated to display similar output for a standard annual cycle. Parameters were assumed to be measured with error, and this uncertainty was propagated through the models by Monte Carlo simulation. Total uncertainty on model output was partitioned, for each model, into six component sums of squares, and components were examined as they changed over the simulated annual cycle. The results indicate that the models differ in their error propagation properties with more complex functions often generating greater uncertainty on output. The contribution of a specific model term to overall error is dependent on its mathematical form (especially, the partial derivative of the term with respect to the parameter) and also its position within the total model. No single model showed the smallest output uncertainty for all possible modeling objectives. The results indicate that the most useful data for testing a model should be gathered during periods of the year when the state variables are changing most rapidly.},

abstract = {Due to a unique combination of environmental conditions, the chaparral shrublands of southern California are prone to large, intense wildland fires. There is ongoing work in the fire research community to establish whether fuel accumulation or weather conditions are the determining factor in the prevalence of large chaparral fires. This study introduces a framework for contributing a modeling perspective to understanding these alternative hypotheses. As models formalize our understanding of the physical process of fire spread, the sensitivity of the models to the meteorological and fuel inputs should be indicators of their relative importance. A global sensitivity analysis (GSA) was conducted on HFire, a spatially explicit raster model developed for modeling fire spread in chaparral fuels, based on the Rothermel spread equations. The GSA provided a quantitative measure of the importance of each of the model inputs on the predicted fire size. The results indicate that, under extreme weather conditions, wind speed was over three times more influential on predicted fire sizes than any other single model input. This finding supports the idea that fires burning under Santa Ana conditions are primarily driven by high wind speeds. Future research will involve extending the GSA methodology to quantify the relative importance of these inputs in terms of the long-term fire regime in chaparral ecosystems.},

abstract = {Several recent papers have suggested replacing the terminology of fire intensity and fire severity. Part of the problem with fire intensity is that it is sometimes used incorrectly to describe fire effects, when in fact it is justifiably restricted to measures of energy output. Increasingly, the term has created confusion because some authors have restricted its usage to a single measure of energy output referred to as fireline intensity. This metric is most useful in understanding fire behavior in forests, but is too narrow to fully capture the multitude of ways fire energy affects ecosystems. Fire intensity represents the energy released during various phases of a fire, and different metrics such as reaction intensity, fireline intensity, temperature, heating duration and radiant energy are useful for different purposes. Fire severity, and the related term burn severity, have created considerable confusion because of recent changes in their usage. Some authors have justified this by contending that fire severity is defined broadly as ecosystem impacts from fire and thus is open to individual interpretation. However, empirical studies have defined fire severity operationally as the loss of or change in organic matter aboveground and belowground, although the precise metric varies with management needs. Confusion arises because fire or burn severity is sometimes defined so that it also includes ecosystem responses. Ecosystem responses include soil erosion, vegetation regeneration, restoration of community structure, faunal recolonization, and a plethora of related response variables. Although some ecosystem responses are correlated with measures of fire or burn severity, many important ecosystem processes have either not been demonstrated to be predicted by severity indices or have been shown in some vegetation types to be unrelated to severity. This is a critical issue because fire or burn severity are readily measurable parameters, both on the ground and with remote sensing, yet ecosystem responses are of most interest to resource managers.},

At the same time, there is growing evidence of climate-driven changes in vegetation structure and function. We summarize these studies and discuss how changes in hydrology interact with changes in terrestrial ecosystems to lead to complex and sometime synergistic responses.

Previous work has found that fuels in the wildland–urban interface and especially in the defensible space (40-m radius) around structures are the most important determinants of the flammability of structures during wildfire. We: (1) examined the extent of outbreaks in the western US and their intersection with the wildland-urban interface and its surrounding area and (2) calculated the combined area of defensible space around all wildland-urban interface housing units in the western US. This analysis indicates that: (1) .98% of areas affected by outbreaks are in remote areas rather than in the wildland-urban interface and (2) in the context of limited resources and the goal of protecting homes and communities from wildfire, the area required to create defensible space around all homes in the wildland-urban interface of the western US (which effectively reduces fire risk to structures) is substantially less than that needed to treat all beetle-affected forests (which does not reduce fire risk to structures as effectively). Thus, focussing fuelreduction treatments in the immediate vicinity of homes and communities rather than in remote beetle-affected forests would be more effective at reducing fire risk to those structures and would incur lower financial and ecological costs.},

abstract = {In the subarctic environment, shortage of nitrogen is common and may have immediate effects on tree survival via lowered photosynthetic capacity in cold periods. Yet, despite the critical role of nitrogen, the subarctic tree mountain birch [Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii (Orlova) Ha¨met-Ahti] shows remarkable variability in tree architecture and leaf traits, which affect its nitrogen use and its ability to capture light. It is possible that intraspecific variation in these traits exhibits alternative strategies for maintaining efficient nitrogen use, provided it results in equal efficiency despite variation in the underlying traits, but true differences between tree individuals may also exist. Computer simulations were used to investigate how daily photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (DPNUE) and the potential rate of photosynthesis (Pmax) of whole birch trees depend on tree architecture, the area or number of leaves per shoot, or nitrogen invested per leaf. The simulations showed that mountain birch has the potential to achieve an equal Pmax or DPNUE by adjusting variation in many traits, but the potential was not realized as a large amount of variation remained when leaf traits measured in the field were used to estimate DPNUE and Pmax. Trade-offs between Pmax, DPNUE, and other tree functions such as resistance to herbivores, growth, maintenance, or reproduction are likely causes for variation.},

We employed the Forest Vegetation Simulator, along with sub-models including the Parallel Processing Extension, Fire and Fuels Extension, andWestwide Pine Beetle Model (WPBM).We also compared responses to treatment scenarios of two bark beetle-caused tree mortality susceptibility rating systems. As hypothesized, thinning treatments led to substantial reduction in potential wildfire severity over time. However, contrary to expectations, the WPBM predicted higher bark beetle-caused mortality from an outbreak in thinned versus unthinned scenarios. Likewise, susceptibility ratings were also higher for thinned stands. Thinning treatments favored retention of early seral species such as ponderosa pine, leading to increases in proportion and average diameter of host trees. Increased surface fuel loadings and incidence of potential crown fire behavior were predicted post-outbreak; however, these effects on potential wildfire behavior were minor relative to effects of thinning.We discuss apparent inconsistencies between simulation outputs and literature, and identify improvements needed in the modeling framework to better address bark beetle-wildfire interactions.},

abstract = {In the support of environmental management, models are frequently used. The outcomes of these models however, rarely show a perfect resemblance to the real-world system behavior. This is due to uncertainties, introduced during the process of abstracting information about the system to include it in the model. To provide decision makers with realistic information about these model outcomes, uncertainty analysis is indispensable. Because of the multiplicity of frameworks available for uncertainty analysis, the outcomes of such analyses are rarely comparable. In this paper a method for structured identification and classification of uncertainties in the application of environmental models is presented. We adapted an existing uncertainty framework to enhance the objectivity in the uncertainty identification process. Two case studies demonstrate how it can help to obtain an overview of unique uncertainties encountered in a model. The presented method improves the comparability of uncertainty analyses in different model studies and leads to a coherent overview of uncertainties affecting model outcomes. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We inferred climate drivers of regionally synchronous surface fires from 1651 to 1900 at 15 sites with existing annually accurate fire-scar chronologies from forests dominated by ponderosa pine or Douglas-fir in the inland Northwest (interior Oregon,Washington and southern British Columbia).Years with widespread fires (35 years with fire at 7 to 11 sites) had warm spring–summers and warm-dry summers, whereas years with no fires at any site (18 years) had the opposite conditions. Spring climate likely affected the length of the fire season via the effects of snowmelt on soil and fuel moisture, whereas summer climate influenced fuel moisture during the fire season. Climate in prior years was not a significant driver of regionally synchronous surface fires, likely because fuels were generally sufficient for the ignition and spread of such fires in these forests. Fires occurred significantly more often than expected by chance when the El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) were both warm phase and less often when they were both cool phase. Interactions between large-scale climate patterns influenced fire synchrony in the inland Northwest because phases of ENSO and PDO were associated with changes in the frequency of warm-dry v. cool-wet spring–summer climate.},

Two fuel management scenarios covering 3% of the fire-prone Algarve region of Portugal and differing in the intensity of treatment in 120-m wide fuel breaks were examined and compared with the no-treatment option. We used the minimum travel time algorithm to simulate the growth of 150 000 fires under the weather conditions historically associated with large fires. Fuel break passive effects on burn probability, area burned, fire size distribution and fire transmission among 20 municipalities were analysed. Treatments decreased large-fire incidence and reduced overall burnt area up to 17% and burn probability between 4% and 31%, depending on fire size class and treatment option. Risk transmission among municipalities varied with community. Although fire distribution shifted and large events were less frequent, mean treatment leverage was very low (1 : 26), revealing a very high cost–benefit ratio and the need for engaging forest owners to act in complementary area-wide fuel treatments. The study assessed the effectiveness of a mitigating solution in a complex socioecological system, contributing to a better-informed wildland fire risk governance process among stakeholders.},

that a lot of resources have been invested in fire prevention and
suppression, the number of fires occurring in the Mediterranean Basin

understanding of the relationship between landscape and fire lies,

Pinus halepensis forests, using Cape Sounion National Park, Central
Greece, as a pilot case. The multi-criteria decision support approach
has been used to synthesize both bio-indicators (woody cover, pine
density, legume cover and relative species richness and annual
colonizers) and geo-indicators (fire history, parent material, and
slope inclination) in order to rank the landscape components. Judgments
related to the significance of each factor were incorporated within the
weights coefficients and then integrated into the multicriteria rule to
map the risk index. Sensitivity analysis was very critical for
assessing the contribution of each factor and the sensitivity to
subjective weight judgments to the final output. The results of this

@article{Scheller2011,
abstract = {Natural resource managers are often challenged with balancing requirements to maintain wildlife populations and to reduce risks of catastrophic or dangerous wildfires. This challenge is exemplified in the Sierra Nevada of California, where proposals to thin vegetation to reduce wildfire risks have been highly controversial, in part because vegetation treatments could adversely affect an imperiled population of the fisher (Martes pennanti) located in the southern Sierra Nevada. The fisher is an uncommon forest carnivore associated with the types of dense, structurally complex forests often targeted for fuel reduction treatments. Vegetation thinning and removal of deadwood structures would reduce fisher habitat value and remove essential habitat elements used by fishers for resting and denning. However, crown-replacing wildfires also threaten the population's habitat, potentially over much broader areas than the treatments intended to reduce wildfire risks. To investigate the potential relative risks of wildfires and fuels treatments on this isolated fisher population, we coupled three spatial models to simulate the stochastic and interacting effects of wildfires and fuels management on fisher habitat and population size: a spatially dynamic forest succession and disturbance model, a fisher habitat model, and a fisher metapopulation model, which assumed that fisher fecundity and survivorship correlate with habitat quality. We systematically varied fuel treatment rate, treatment intensity, and fire regime, and assessed their relative effects on the modeled fisher population over 60 years. After estimating the number of adult female fishers remaining at the end of each simulation scenario, we compared the immediate negative effects of fuel treatments to the longer-term positive effect of fuel treatment (via reduction of fire hazard) using structural equation modeling. Our simulations suggest that the direct, negative effects of fuel treatments on fisher population size are generally smaller than the indirect, positive effects of fuel treatments, because fuels treatments reduced the probability of large wildfires that can damage and fragment habitat over larger areas. The benefits of fuel treatments varied by elevation and treatment location with the highest net benefits to fisher found at higher elevations and within higher quality fisher habitat. Simulated fire regime also had a large effect with the largest net benefit of fuel treatments occurring when a more severe fire regime was simulated. However, there was large uncertainty in our projections due to stochastic spatial and temporal wildfires dynamic and fisher population dynamics. Our results demonstrate the difficulty of projecting future populations in systems characterized by large, infrequent, stochastic disturbances. Nevertheless, these coupled models offer a useful decision-support system for evaluating the relative effects of alternative management scenarios; and uncertainties can be reduced as additional data accumulate to refine and validate the models.},

abstract = {1. Coarse woody debris (CWD) is an important component of temperate stream and forest ecosystems. We have reviewed the rates at which CWD is added and removed from ecosystems, the biomass found in streams and forests, and many functions that CWD serves. 2. CWD is added to ecosystems by numerous mechanisms, including wind, fire, insect attack, pathogens, competition, and geomorphic processes. Despite the many long-term studies on tree mortality, there are few published rates of CWD input on mass-area-1 time-1 basis. Most ecological studies have not measured CWD input over a long enough period or a large enough area to give accurate estimates. Input rates measured in temperate ecosystems range from 0.12 to 14.9 Mg ha-1 year-1 and vary greatly over time and space. 3. Once CWD enters the detrital food web, it is decomposed by a large array of organisms and physical processes. Although respiration-caused losses have been the focus of many studies, CWD is also significantly transformed physically and chemically. Movement of CWD, especially in streams, is also an important but poorly documented mechanism whereby CWD is lost from ecosystems. Many factors control the rate at which CWD decomposes, including temperature, moisture, the internal gas composition of CWD, substrate quality, the size of the CWD, and the types of organisms involved. However, the importance of many of these factors has yet to be established in field experiments. 4. The mass of CWD in an ecosystem ideally represents the balance between addition and loss. In reality, slow decomposition rates and erratic variations in input of CWD cause the CWD mass to deviate markedly from steady-state projections. The mass of CWD in stream and forest ecosystems varies widely, ranging between 1 and 269 Mg ha-1. Many differences correspond to forest type, with deciduous-dominated systems having generally lower biomass than conifer-dominated systems. However, conifer-dominated systems with low productivity also have low CWD mass. Stream size also influences CWD mass in lotic ecosystems, while successional stage dramatically influences CWD mass in boat aquatic and terrestrial settings. 5. CWD performs many functions in ecosystems, serving as auto-trophic and heterotrophic habitat and strongly influencing geomorphic processes, especially in streams. It is also a major component of nutrient cycles in many ecosystems. We have reviewed these many functions and conclude that CWD is an important functional component of stream and forest ecosystems. 6. Humans have greatly affected the amount of CWD found in temperate ecosystems by removing CWD and by changing the rate of input and the rate and pattern of loss. In some cases, human influences have been so pervasive that natural conditions are difficult to define. Management practices concerning CWD often have not been based on the numerous beneficial roles this material plays in ecosystems. Better scientific understanding of these functions and the natural factors influencing CWD dynamics should lead to more enlightened management practices.

abstract = {In this study we examine fire history (i.e. c. 500 yrbp to present) of Araucaria– Nothofagus forests in the Andes cordillera of Chile. This is the first fire history developed from tree rings for an Araucaria– Nothofagus forest landscape. The fire history was determined for the Quillelhue watershed on the north side of Lanin volcano in Villarrica National Park, Chile. The long-lived Araucaria araucana was commonly associated with Nothofagus pumilio and N. antarctica in more mesic and drier sites respectively. Based on a combination of fire-scar proxy records and forest stand ages, we reconstructed fire frequency, severity, and the spatial extent of burned areas for an c. 4000 ha study area. We used a composite fire chronology for the purpose of determining centennial-scale changes in fire regimes and comparing the pre-settlement (pre-1883) and post-settlement fire regimes. In addition, we contrasted Araucaria and Nothofagus species as fire-scar recorders. In the study area, we dated a total of 144 fire-scarred trees, representing 46 fire years fromad 1446 to the present. For the period fromad 1696 to 2000, using fire dates from Araucaria and Nothofagus species, the composite mean fire interval varied from 7 years for all fires to 62 years for widespread events (i.e. years in which≥ 25% of recorder trees were scarred). Sensitivity to fire was different for Araucaria and Nothofagus species. More than 98% of the fires recorded by Nothofagus species occurred during the 1900s. The lack of evidence for older fire dates (pre-1900) in Nothofagus species was due to their shorter longevity and greater susceptibility to being killed by more severe fires. Whereas the thin-barked N. pumilio and N. antarctica are often destroyed in catastrophic fire events, large and thick-barked Araucaria trees typically survive. The spatial extent of fires ranged from small patchy events to those that burned more than 40% of the entire landscape ( c.> 1500 ha). Fire is the most important disturbance shaping the Araucaria– Nothofagus landscape in the Araucarian region. The forest landscape has been shaped by a mixed-severity fire regime that includes surface and crown fires. High-severity widespread events were relatively infrequent (e.g. 1827, 1909 and 1944) and primarily affected tall Araucaria– N. pumilio forests and woodlands dominated by Araucaria– N. antarctica. Although there is abundant evidence of the impact of Euro-Chilean settlers on the area, the relative influence of this settlement on the temporal pattern of fire could only be tentatively established due to the relatively small number of pre-1900 fire dates. An apparent increase in fire occurrence is evident in the fire record during Euro-Chilean settlement (post-1880s) compared with the Native American era, but it may also be the result of the destruction of evidence of older fires by more recent stand-devastating fires (e.g. 1909 and 1944). Overall, the severe and widespread fires that burned in Araucaria– Nothofagus forests of this region in 2002, previously interpreted as an ecological novelty, are within the range of the historic fire regimes that have shaped this forested landscape.

abstract = {Wildfire alters the hydrologic response of watersheds, including the peak discharges resulting from subsequent rainfall, Improving predictions of the magnitude of flooding that follows wildfire is needed because of the increase in human population at risk in the wildland-urban interface. Because this wildland-urban interface is typically in mountainous terrain, we investigated rainfall-runoff relations by measuring the maximum 30 min rainfall intensity and the unit-area peak discharge (peak discharge divided by the area burned) in three mountainous watersheds (17-26.8 km(2)) after a wildfire. We found rainfall-runoff relations that relate the unit-area peak discharges to the maximum 30 min rainfall intensities by a power law. These rainfall-runoff relations appear to have a threshold value for the maximum 30 min rainfall intensity (around 10 mm h(-1)) such that, above this threshold, the magnitude of the flood peaks increases more rapidly with increases in intensity. This rainfall intensity could be used to set threshold limits in rain gauges that are part of an early-warning flood system after wildfire. The maximum unit-area peak discharges from these three burned watersheds ranged from 3.2 to 50 m(3) s(-1) km(-2). These values could provide initial estimates of the upper limits of runoff that can be used to predict floods after wildfires in mountainous terrain. Published in 2001 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The majority of wildfires in Spain are caused by human activities. However, much wildfire research has focused on the biological and physical aspects of wildfire, with comparatively less attention given to the importance of socio-economic factors. With recent changes in human activity and settlement patterns in many parts of Spain, potentially contributing to the increases in wildfire occurrence recently observed, the need to consider human activity in models of wildfire risk for this region are apparent. Here we use a method from Bayesian statistics, the weights of evidence (WofE) model, to examine the causal factors of wildfires in the south west of the Madrid region for two differently defined wildfire seasons. We also produce predictive maps of wildfire risk. Our results show that spatial patterns of wildfire ignition are strongly associated with human access to the natural landscape, with proximity to urban areas and roads found to be the most important causal factors We suggest these characteristics and recent socio-economic trends in Spain may be producing landscapes and wildfire ignition risk characteristics that are increasingly similar to Mediterranean regions with historically stronger economies, such as California, where the urban-wildland interface is large and recreation in forested areas is high. We also find that the WofE model is useful for estimating future wildfire risk. We suggest the methods presented here will be useful to optimize time, human resources and fire management funds in areas where urbanization is increasing the urban-forest interface and where human activity is an important cause of wildfire ignition.},

abstract = {We present an overview of the Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS), a tool that enables land managers, regulators, and scientists to create and catalogue fuelbeds and to classify those fuelbeds for their capacity to support fire and consume fuels. The fuelbed characteristics and fire classification from this tool will provide inputs for current and future sophisticated models for the quantification of fire behavior, fire effects, and carbon accounting and enable assessment of fuel treatment effectiveness. The system was designed from requirements provided by land managers, scientists, and policy makers gathered through six regional workshops. The FCCS contains a set of fuelbeds representing the United States, which were compiled from scientific literature, fuels photo series, fuels data sets, and expert opinion. The system enables modification and enhancement of these fuelbeds to represent a particular scale of interest. The FCCS then reports assigned and calculated fuel characteristics for each existing fuelbed stratum including the canopy, shrubs, nonwoody, woody, litter–lichen–moss, and duff. Finally, the system classifies each fuelbed by calculating fire potentials that provide an index of the intrinsic capacity of each fuelbed to support surface fire behavior, support crown fire, and provide fuels for flaming, smoldering, and residual consumption. The FCCS outputs are being used in a national wildland fire emissions inventory and in the development of fuelbed, fire hazard, and treatment effectiveness maps on several national forests. Although the FCCS was built for the United States, the conceptual framework is applicable worldwide.},

abstract = {We provide an empirical, global test of the varying constraints hypothesis, which predicts systematic heterogeneity in the relative importance of biomass resources to burn and atmospheric conditions suitable to burning (weather/climate) across a spatial gradient of long-term resource availability. Analyses were based on relationships between monthly global wildfire activity, soil moisture, and mid-tropospheric circulation data from 2001 to 2007, synthesized across a gradient of long-term averages in resources (net primary productivity), annual temperature, and terrestrial biome. We demonstrate support for the varying constraints hypothesis, showing that, while key biophysical factors must coincide for wildfires to occur, the relative influence of resources to burn and moisture/weather conditions on fire activity shows predictable spatial patterns. In areas where resources are always available for burning during the fire season, such as subtropical/tropical biomes with mid-high annual long-term net primary productivity, fuel moisture conditions exert their strongest constraint on fire activity. In areas where resources are more limiting or variable, such as deserts, xeric shrublands, or grasslands/savannas, fuel moisture has a diminished constraint on wildfire, and metrics indicating availability of burnable fuels produced during the antecedent wet growing seasons reflect a more pronounced constraint on wildfire. This macro-scaled evidence for spatially varying constraints provides a synthesis with studies performed at local and regional scales, enhances our understanding of fire as a global process, and indicates how sensitivity to future changes in temperature and precipitation may differ across the world.},

abstract = {Flux balance analysis (FBA) provides a framework for the estimation of intracellular fluxes and energy balance analysis (EBA) ensures the thermodynamic feasibility of the computed optimal fluxes. Previously, these techniques have been used to obtain optimal fluxes that maximize a single objective. Because mammalian systems perform various functions, a multi-objective approach is needed when seeking optimal flux distributions in such systems. For example, hepatocytes perform several metabolic functions at various levels depending on environmental conditions; furthermore, there is a potential benefit to enhance some of these functions for applications such as bioartificial liver (BAL) support devices. Herein we developed a multi-objective optimization approach that couples the normalized Normal Constraint (NC) with both FBA and EBA to obtain multi-objective Pareto-optimal solutions. We investigated the Pareto frontiers in gluconeogenic and glycolytic hepatocytes for various combinations of liver-specific objectives (albumin synthesis, glutathione synthesis, NADPH synthesis, ATP generation, and urea secretion). Next, we evaluated the impact of experimental flux measurements on the Pareto frontiers. We found that measurements induce dramatic changes in Pareto frontiers and further constrain the network fluxes. This multi-objective optimality analysis may help explain certain features of the metabolic control of hepatocytes, which is relevant to the response to hepatocytes and liver to various physiological stimuli and disease states.},

Mean squared error of predicted uncompacted crown ratio was between 0.1 and 0.15, overall bias was negligible, and correlation between the predicted and observed uncompacted crown ratio was high for most species. The sensitivity of crown fire risk to crown ratio estimation method was evaluated using the Fire and Fuels Extension of the Forest Vegetation Simulator. Torching index, an estimate of the wind speed needed for a crown fire to develop, was significantly greater when compacted crown ratio was used instead of uncompacted crown ratio.

abstract = {Models of vegetation change in response to global warming need to incorporate the effects of disturbance at broad spatial scales. Process-based predictive models, whether for fire behavior or fire effects on vegetation, assume homogeneity of crucial inputs over the spatial scale to which they are applied. Landscape disturbance models predict final burning patterns, but either do not model mechanistic behavior and explicit spread rates, or require large amounts of data to initialize simulations and predict ecological effects. Empirical data on the ecological effects of fire are not generally available at these scales, and conclusions are often extrapolated upward from standlevel data. Three methods for extrapolating ecological effects of fire across spatial scales and the sources of error associated with each were identified: (1) extrapolating fire behavior models directly to larger spatial scales; (2) integrating fire behavior and fire effects models with successional models at the stand level, then extrapolating upward; and (3) aggregating model inputs to the scale of interest. Extreme fire events present a challenging problem for modelers, regardless of which extrapolation method is employed. No single approach to modeling fire effects is inherently superior; modeling objectives and thecharacteristics of specific systems will determine the best strategy for each situation.},

Our proposed model correctly predicted each instance of crown fire presented in the seminal study.We then tested the proposed model for statistical equivalence to the original Van Wagner model using two contemporary techniques to parameterize canopy bulk density.We found the proposed and original models to be statistically equivalent when canopy bulk density was parameterized using the method incorporated in the Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator (difference<0.5 km h−1, $\alpha$=0.05, n=2626), but notwhen parameterized using the method of Cruz and others.

Since no model is perfect, available ecosystem models may be described as invalid but useful models. Model validation thus requires an objective evaluation of the performance of the model. The following performance criteria are proposed. Adequacy is the fraction of system behavior which is duplicated by the model, and reliability is the fraction of model behavior which duplicates system behavior. Some uses of these criteria in model evaluation are suggested, and Bayes' theorem is used to show how a model of adequacy 0.5 or greater may be used to reduce sample size in an experimental program.},

abstract = {Ecological systems contain a huge amount of quantitative variation between and within species and locations, which makes it difficult to obtain unambiguous verification of theoretical predictions. Ordinary experiments consider just a few explanatory factors and are prone to providing oversimplified answers because they ignore the complexity of the factors that underlie variation. We used multi-objective optimization (MO) for a mechanistic analysis of the potential ecological and evolutionary causes and consequences of variation in the life-history traits of a species of moth. Optimal life-history solutions were sought for environmental conditions where different life stages of the moth were subject to predation and other known fitness-reducing factors in a manner that was dependent on the duration of these life stages and on variable mortality rates. We found that multi-objective optimal solutions to these conditions that the moths regularly experience explained most of the life-history variation within this species. Our results demonstrate that variation can have a causal interpretation even for organisms under steady conditions. The results suggest that weather and species interactions can act as underlying causes of variation, and MO acts as a corresponding adaptive mechanism that maintains variation in the traits of organisms.},

Simplified statistical procedures for operational model evaluation are suggested. The fundamental model performance measures are the mean bias, the mean square error, and the correlation. The bootstrap resampling technique is used to estimate confidence limits on the performance measures, In order to determine if a model agrees satisfactorily with data or if one model is significantly different from another model. Applications to two tracer experiments are described. It is emphasized that review and evaluation of the scientific components of models are often of greater Importance than the strictly statistical evaluation. A necessary condition for acceptance Of a model should be that it Is scientifically correct. It Is shown that even in research-grade tracer experiments, data Input errors can cause errors In hourly-average model predictions of point concentrations almost as large as the predictions themselves. The turbulent or stochastic component of model uncertainty has a similar magnitude. These components of the uncertainty decrease as averaging time increases.},

abstract = {In scientometric research, the use of cooccurrence data is very common. In many cases, a similarity measure is employed to normalize the data. However, there is no consensus among researchers on which similarity measure is most appropriate for normalization purposes. In this article, we theoretically analyze the properties of similarity measures for cooccurrence data, focusing in particular on four well-known measures: the association strength, the cosine, the inclusion index, and the Jaccard index.We also study the behavior of these measures empirically. Our analysis reveals that there exist two fundamentally different types of similarity measures,namely, set-theoretic measures and probabilistic measures. The association strength is a probabilistic measure, while the cosine, the inclusion index, and the Jaccard index are set-theoretic measures. Both our theoretical and our empirical results indicate that cooccurrence data can best be normalized using a probabilistic measure. This provides strong support for the use of the association strength in scientometric research.},

abstract = {Effectively resolving a typical ecological policy issue requires providing an array of scientific information to decision makers. In my experience, the ability of scientists (and scientific information) to inform constructively ecological policy deliberations has been diminished when what is offered as "science" is inculcated with policy preferences. As with all human activity, the scientific enterprise is not free of values, but values reflected in subtle form as policy preferences should not be permitted to prejudice scientific information. Scientific information becomes "normative" when it contains tacit policy preferences and thus, by extension, promotes particular policy options. There are many examples of normative science confusing the development of sound ecological policy when it operates under the guise of policy neutral science. With its disguised value and preference characteristics, normative science provides little substantive help in reconciling the most divisive elements of ecological policy. In my opinion, scientists should play the important role of informing policy discussions with unbiased, understandable scientific information, assessments, and forecasts. To develop sound policy, science is important, helpful, perhaps even essential, but involvement with policy issues by a naive scientist or scientific organization can lead to loss of credibility and perceived independence unless the proper roles of both science and policy are understood and followed.},

abstract = {Dry forests of the western United States (ponderosa pine, dry mixed conifer) are often considered at risk of uncharacteristic severe fires, but recent research has found historically extensive severe fire. This has left divergent perspectives about how to restore dry forests, protect people and infrastructure from fire, and interpret the ecological effects of large fires, such as the 2013 Rim fire, a human-set 104,000 ha fire in the western Sierra Nevada Mountains. To help resolve this uncertainty, I used new methods to reconstruct historical forest structure and fire and test 11 hypotheses about them, using A.D. 1865–1885 General Land Office surveys, across 330,000 ha of Sierran mixed-conifer forests. The reconstructions show these historical forests were open and park-like in places, but generally dense, averaging 293 trees/ha; shade-tolerant trees and large trees were abundant, but smaller (<60 cm diameter) pines and oaks numerically dominated. These smaller trees, along with common understory seedlings and saplings and almost pervasive shrubs, created abundant ladder fuels. It is not surprising, given these conditions, that just 13–26% of historical Sierran mixed-conifer forests had only low-severity fire, with mixed-severity fire over 43–48%, and high-severity fire over 31–39% of the land area. The high-severity fire rotation was 281 years in the northern and 354 years in the southern Sierra, short enough to contribute to high levels of heterogeneity, including abundant areas and large patches (up to 9400 ha) of early-successional forest and montane chaparral, but long enough to allow recovery of old-growth forest over large land areas. Proposals to reduce fuels and fire severity would actually reduce, not restore, historical forest heterogeneity important to wildlife and resiliency. Sierran mixed-conifer forests are inherently dangerous places to live, which cannot be changed without creating artificial forests over large land areas. However, people can adapt to fires by channeling development to safer areas and modifying ignition zones near houses and communities to survive fire.

For the shrinkage properties, computed results were compared with experimental values measured on a set of samples depicting a very large diversity of anatomical patterns. The accuracy of our prediction is about 5% in the tangential direction and 20% in the radial direction, which is much better than statistical models over a wide range of variables. These results are discussed and a few microscopic observations with ESEM allow explanation of anomaly points of behaviour to be formulated. Such good results could allow this approach to be used to study the influence of growing conditions or of global changes upon physical wood properties.},

Bias may result from aggregation of a k component model into k-n components. For some models, total error can be segregated into the errors resulting from pair-wise aggregation of components. Minimal errors result if the components with similar turnover times are aggregated, or small components are lumped with larger ones. Propagation of measurement error by Monte Carlo methods shows that errors are affected by model structure, the relationships among parameters and the position of a component within the system. Explicit results indicate that natural variability (genetic, spatial, etc.) is poorly represented by mean parameter values, but predictability is improved if approximate probability distributions are considered.},

CONSUME and the First Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM), predictive models developed to estimate fuel consumption and emissions from wildland fires, have not been systematically evaluated for application in the eastern US using the same validation data set. In this study, we compiled a fuel consumption data set from 54 operational prescribed fires (43 pine and 11 mixed hardwood sites) to assess each model's uncertainties and application limits. Regions of indifference between measured and predicted values by fuel category and forest type represent the potential error that modelers could incur in estimating fuel consumption by category. Overall, FOFEM predictions have narrower regions of indifference than CONSUME and suggest better correspondence between measured and predicted consumption. However, both models offer reliable predictions of live fuel (shrubs and herbaceous vegetation) and 1 h fine fuels. Results suggest that CONSUME and FOFEM can be improved in their predictive capability for woody fuel, litter, and duff consumption for eastern US forests. Because of their high biomass and potential smoke management problems, refining estimates of litter and duff consumption is of particular importance.},

abstract = {Ecologists and forest managers both recognize the importance of detailed
spatio-temporal knowledge on local small-scale disturbances (SSD)
dynamics and impacts. However, a large proportion of the knowledge about
SSD is based on temporally short data sets, and on non-spatial analysis.
SORTIE, a stochastic and mechanistic spatially explicit and
individual-based forest succession model, is particularly well suited
for simulating SSD and overcoming traditional field studies limitations.
Our main goal is to investigate the potential of SORTIE for
spatio-temporal analysis of SSD. More specifically, we intend to
evaluate the model sensitivity to initial conditions, and to assess the
impact of introduced minor disturbances on the species densities. We
hypothesize that SORTIE will generate realistic species dynamics within
the range of tested scenarios. We performed simulations over a period of
1000 years using two different initial spatial configurations (Random
and Aggregated) and fifteen replicates. For each replicate we extracted,
at each time step of 5 years, the species local spatial structure with
the use of the Ripley's K statistic. The resulting time series periods
and trends were compared between initial condition scenarios by
performing phase coherence and regression analysis. In another set of
simulations, SSD of different sizes (500, 800 and 1100 m(2)) were
introduced at two distinct time steps (400 and 600 years). Species
density time series were analyzed again in terms of periodicity and
trend. Results indicate a sensitivity to initial conditions limited to
the first 300 years, and a very similar species local spatial structure
between the scenarios after that period. Also, statistical tests
revealed that the species densities are not sensitive to single
introduced SSD, for all SSD sizes and moments of disturbance. These
conclusions suggest that SORTIE can be a valuable complementary tool to
SSD field studies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Biomass burning emission inventories serve as critical input for atmospheric chemical transport models that are used to understand the role of biomass fires in the chem-ical composition of the atmosphere, air quality, and the cli-mate system. Significant progress has been achieved in the development of regional and global biomass burning emis-sion inventories over the past decade using satellite remote sensing technology for fire detection and burned area map-ping. However, agreement among biomass burning emis-sion inventories is frequently poor. Furthermore, the un-certainties of the emission estimates are typically not well characterized, particularly at the spatio-temporal scales per-tinent to regional air quality modeling. We present the Wildland Fire Emission Inventory (WFEI), a high resolution model for non-agricultural open biomass burning (hereafter referred to as wildland fires, WF) in the contiguous United States (CONUS). The model combines observations from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on the Terra and Aqua satellites, meteorological anal-yses, fuel loading maps, an emission factor database, and fuel condition and fuel consumption models to estimate emis-sions from WF. WFEI was used to estimate emissions of CO (ECO) and PM 2.5 (EPM 2.5) for the western United States from 2003– 2008. The uncertainties in the inventory estimates of ECO and EPM 2.5 (u ECO and u EPM 2.5 , respectively) have been ex-plored across spatial and temporal scales relevant to regional and global modeling applications. In order to evaluate the un-certainty in our emission estimates across multiple scales we used a figure of merit, the half mass uncertainty u EX (where X = CO or PM 2.5), defined such that for a given aggrega-tion level 50 % of total emissions occurred from elements Correspondence to: S. P. Urbanski (surbanski@fs.fed.us) with u EX u EX . The sensitivity of the WFEI estimates of ECO and EPM 2.5 to uncertainties in mapped fuel loading, fuel consumption, burned area and emission factors have also been examined. The estimated annual, domain wide ECO ranged from 436 Gg yr −1 in 2004 to 3107 Gg yr −1 in 2007. The extremes in estimated annual, domain wide EPM 2.5 were 65 Gg yr −1 in 2004 and 454 Gg yr −1 in 2007. Annual WF emissions were a significant share of total emissions from non-WF sources (agriculture, dust, non-WF fire, fuel combustion, industrial processes, transportation, solvent, and miscella-neous) in the western United States as estimated in a national emission inventory. In the peak fire year of 2007, WF emis-sions were ∼20 % of total (WF + non-WF) CO emissions and ∼39 % of total PM 2.5 emissions. During the months with the greatest fire activity, WF accounted for the majority of total CO and PM 2.5 emitted across the study region. Uncer-tainties in annual, domain wide emissions was 28 % to 51 % for CO and 40 % to 65 % for PM 2.5 . Sensitivity o u ECO an u EPM 2.5 to the emission model components depended on scale. At scales relevant to regional modeling applications (= 10 km, = 1 day) WFEI estimates 50 % of total ECO with an uncertainty <133 % and half of total EPM 2.5 with an uncertainty <146 % u ECO an u EPM 2.5 are reduced by more than half at the scale of global modeling applications (= 100 km, = 30 day) where 50 % of total emissions are estimated with an uncertainty <50 % for CO and <64 % for PM 2.5 .

This document is a companion to The Forest Inventory and Analysis Database: Database Description and Users Manual, Version 4.0 for P2. To use the Forest Inventory and Analysis Database (FIADB) effectively, users should acquire a basic understanding of Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) sampling and estimation procedures. Generally described, FIA uses a threephase sampling scheme. Phase 1 (P1) is used for stratification, while phase 2 (P2) consists of plots that are visited or photo-interpreted. A subset of P2 plots are designated as phase 3 (P3) plots, which were formerly known as Forest Health Monitoring (FHM) plots, where additional health indicator attributes are collected. Phase 3 is described in this chapter, but phases 1 and 2 are described in a separate users manual (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service 2010). The exception is P3 crown attributes, which are described in the TREE table of the P2 document (available online at www.fia.fs.fed.us.) Although the FIADB is used widely within the FIA program, much if not most of the intended audience includes those outside FIA who are interested in using FIA data for their own analyses. Awareness of the potential uses of FIA data by users outside the FIA community is growing, and the data become increasingly useful as additional data are collected. However, as is the case with any data source, the user needs to understand not only the data definitions and acquisition methods, but also the context in which the data were collected.

abstract = {In ecological field surveys, observations are gathered at different spatial locations. The purpose may be to relate biological response variables (e.g., species abundances) to explanatory environmental variables (e.g., soil characteristics). In the absence of prior knowledge, ecologists have been taught to rely on systematic or random sampling designs. If there is prior knowledge about the spatial patterning of the explanatory variables, obtained from either previous surveys or a pilot study, can we use this information to optimize the sampling design in order to maximize our ability to detect the relationships between the response and explanatory variables? The specific questions addressed in this paper are: a) What is the effect (type I error) of spatial autocorrelation on the statistical tests commonly used by ecologists to analyse field survey data? b) Can we eliminate, or at least minimize, the effect of spatial autocorrelation by the design of the survey? Are there designs that provide greater power for surveys, at least under certain circumstances? c) Can we eliminate or control for the effect of spatial autocorrelation during the analysis? To answer the last question, we compared regular regression analysis to a modified t-test developed by Dutilleul for correlation coefficients in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Replicated surfaces (typically, 1000 of them) were simulated using different spatial parameters, and these surfaces were subjected to different sampling designs and methods of statistical analysis. The simulated surfaces may represent, for example, vegetation response to underlying environmental variation. This allowed us 1) to measure the frequency of type I error (the failure to reject the null hypothesis when in fact there is no effect of the environment on the response variable) and 2) to estimate the power of the different combinations of sampling designs and methods of statistical analysis (power is measured by the rate of rejection of the null hypothesis when an effect of the environment on the response variable has been created). Our results indicate that: 1) Spatial autocorrelation in both the response and environmental variables affects the classical tests of significance of correlation or regression coefficients. Spatial autocorrelation in only one of the two variables does not affect the test of significance. 2) A broad-scale spatial structure present in data has the same effect on the tests as spatial autocorrelation. When such a structure is present in one of the variables and autocorrelation is found in the other, or in both, the tests of significance have inflated rates of type I error. 3) Dutilleul's modified t-test for the correlation coefficient, corrected for spatial autocorrelation, effectively corrects for spatial autocorrelation in the data. It also effectively corrects for the presence of deterministic structures, with or without spatial autocorrelation. The presence of a broad-scale deterministic structure may, in some cases, reduce the power of the modified t-test. P. Legendre},

abstract = {Fire exclusion in mixed conifer forests has increased the risk of fire due to decades of fuel accumulation. Restoration of fire into altered forests is a challenge because of a poor understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of fire regimes. In this study the spatial and temporal characteristics of fire regimes and forest age structure are recon-structed in a 2325-ha mixed conifer forest in the Klamath Mountains. Forests were multiaged and burned frequently at low and moderate severity, but forest age structure did not vary with aspect, elevation, or topographic position. Recently there has been an increase in forest density and a forest compositional shift to shade-tolerant species. Median fire return in-tervals (FRI) ranged from 11.5 to 16.5 yr and varied with aspect but not with forest composition or elevation. The median area burned was 106 ha, and the pre-Euro-American fire rotation of 19 yr increased to 238 yr after 1905. Intra-annual position of fire scars in the tree rings indicates that 93% of fires occurred during the dry midsummer through fall period. Spatial patterns of sites with similar fire dates were spatially coherent and separated from others by topographic features that influence fire spread. Thus, patterns of fire oc-currence tended to be fixed in space with timing of fires varying among groups of sites. Spatial and temporal patterns of fire occurrence suggest that managers using physical fea-tures to contain prescribed fire will create burn patterns consistent with historical fires in the Klamath Mountains.},

abstract = {A systematic review and harmonization of life cycle assessment (LCA)
literature of nuclear electricity generation technologies was performed
to determine causes of and, where possible, reduce variability in
estimates of life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to clarify the
state of knowledge and inform decision making. LCA literature indicates
that life cycle GHG emissions from nuclear power are a fraction of
traditional fossil sources, but the conditions and assumptions under
which nuclear power are deployed can have a significant impact on the
magnitude of life cycle GHG emissions relative to renewable
technologies. Screening 274 references yielded 27 that reported 99
independent estimates of life cycle GHG emissions from light water
reactors (LWRs). The published median, interquartile range (IQR), and
range for the pool of LWR life cycle GHG emission estimates were 13, 23,
and 220 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour (g
CO2-eq/kWh), respectively. After harmonizing methods to use consistent
gross system boundaries and values for several important system
parameters, the same statistics were 12, 17, and 110 g CO2-eq/kWh,
respectively. Harmonization (especially of performance characteristics)
clarifies the estimation of central tendency and variability. To explain
the remaining variability, several additional, highly influential
consequential factors were examined using other methods. These factors
included the primary source energy mix, uranium ore grade, and the
selected LCA method. For example, a scenario analysis of future global
nuclear development examined the effects of a decreasing global uranium
market-average ore grade on life cycle GHG emissions. Depending on
conditions, median life cycle GHG emissions could be 9 to 110 g
CO2-eq/kWh by 2050.},

In this paper, three types of power-law characteristics of forest fires are investigated. The first one is the distribution of fire areas. The frequency–area distribution is found obeying good power-law relation that is invariant with time. The second one is the distribution of fire intervals. It is indicated that the frequency–interval distribution of forest fires in Japan is also accord with power law. What is the most interesting is that the frequency–interval distribution is a power lawwith periodic change, different to that of frequency–size distribution. The third one is the distribution of fire probability against population density. There is positive-exponent power-law relation between fire probability and population density. The results discussed in this paper are expected to promote the forest-fire danger rating method and are helpful to understand the ecological action of forest fires.},

abstract = {Several recent studies in landscape ecology have found periodicity in correlograms or semi-variograms calculated, for instance, from spatial data of soils, forests, or animal populations. Some of the studies interpreted this as an indication of regular or periodic landscape patterns. This interpretation is in disagreement with other studies that doubt whether such analysis is valid. The objective of our study was to explore the relationship between periodicity in landscape patterns and geostatistical models. We were especially interested in the validity of the assumption that periodicity in geostatistical models indicates periodicity in landscape pattern, and whether the former can characterize frequency and magnitude of the latter. We created maps containing various periodic spatial patterns, derived correlograms from these, and examined periodicity in the correlograms. We also created non-regular maps that we suspected would cause periodicity in correlograms. Our results demonstrate that a) various periodic spatial patterns produce periodicity in correlograms derived from them, b) the distance-lags at which correlograms peak correspond to the average distances between patch centers, c) periodicity is strongest when the diameter of patches is equal to the distance between patch edges, d) periodicity in omni-directional correlograms of complex spatial patterns (such as checkerboards) are combinations of several waves because inter-patch distances differ with direction; multiple directional correlograms can decompose such complexity, and e) periodicity in correlograms can also be caused when the number of patches in a study site is small. These results highlight that correlograms can be used to detect and describe regular spatial patterns. However, it is crucial to ensure that the assumption of stationarity is not violated, i.e., that the study area contains a sufficiently large number of patches to avoid incorrect conclusions.},

abstract = {Wildfires statistics for the conterminous United States (U.S.) are examined in a spatially and temporally explicit manner. We use a high-resolution data set consisting of 88,916 U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service wildfires over the time period 1970-2000 and consider wildfire occurrence as a function of ecoregion (land units classified by climate, vegetation, and topography), ignition source (anthropogenic vs. lightning), and decade. For the conterminous U.S., we (t) find that wildfires exhibit robust frequency-area power-law behavior in 18 different ecoregions; (ii) use normalized power-law exponents to compare the scaling of wildfire-burned areas between ecoregions, finding a systematic change from east to west; (iii) find that wildfires in the eastern third of the U.S. have higher power-law exponents for anthropogenic vs. lightning ignition sources; and (iv) calculate recurrence intervals for wildfires of a given burned area or larger for each ecoregion, allowing for the classification of wildfire regimes for probabilistic hazard estimation in the same vein as is now used for earthquakes.},

Some one-off mention of self-organization. "Thus, variation in beta between ecoregions may indicate differences in energy balance and rates of energy release in ecosystems according to differences in climate."
"..self-organize through the feedbacks described above to ensure that energy is dissipated at the maximum rate across scales"


So...
Self-organization is assumed (or presumed) when power-laws are observed (citing SOC and SODP). (not mentioning the skepticism with which we view their power-law fits).
But, if you look beyond fire sizes to fire propogation, self-organization is not sufficiently robust to explain patterns of fire spread. Fire spread is regulated by topography, and weather (which also provides energy?), mitigating self-organization. Self-organization can be primary in some regulatory environments, but not all and not universally, and certainly not at such broad scales.},

abstract = {We investigate interactions between successive naturally occurring fires, and assess to what extent the environments in which fires burn influence these interactions. Using mapped fire perimeters and satellite-based estimates of post-fire effects (referred to hereafter as fire severity) for 19 fires burning relatively freely over a 31-year period, we demonstrate that fire as a landscape process can exhibit self-limiting characteristics in an upper elevation Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forest. We use the term ‘self-limiting' to refer to recurring fire as a process over time (that is, fire regime) consuming fuel and ultimately constraining the spatial extent and lessening fire-induced effects of subsequent fires. When the amount of time between successive adjacent fires is under 9 years, and when fire weather is not extreme (burning index <34.9), the probability of the latter fire burning into the previous fire area is extremely low. Analysis of fire severity data by 10-year periods revealed a fair degree of stability in the proportion of area burned among fire severity classes (unchanged, low, moderate, high). This is in contrast to a recent study demonstrating increasing high-severity burning throughout the Sierra Nevada from 1984 to 2006, which suggests freely burning fires over time in upper elevation Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forests can regulate fire-induced effects across the landscape. This information can help managers better anticipate short- and long-term effects of allowing naturally ignited fires to burn, and ultimately, improve their ability to implement Wildland Fire Use programs in similar forest types.},

abstract = {Physics-based coupled fire - atmosphere models are based on approximations to the governing equations of fluid dynamics, combustion, and the thermal degradation of solid fuel. They require significantly more computational resources than the most commonly used fire spread models, which are semi-empirical or empirical. However, there are a number of fire behaviour problems, of increasing relevance, that are outside the scope of empirical and semi-empirical models. Examples are wildland-urban interface fires, assessing how well fuel treatments work to reduce the intensity of wild land fires, and investigating the mechanisms and conditions underlying blow- up fires and fire spread through heterogeneous fuels. These problems are not amenable to repeatable full-scale field studies. Suitably validated coupled atmosphere - fire models are one way to address these problems. This paper describes the development of a three-dimensional, fully transient, physics-based computer simulation approach for modelling fire spread through surface fuels. Grassland fires were simulated and compared to findings from Australian experiments. Predictions of the head fire spread rate for a range of ambient wind speeds and ignition line-fire lengths compared favourably to experiments. In addition, two specific experimental cases were simulated in order to evaluate how well the model predicts the development of the entire fire perimeter.},

fly-eye contacts, the remainder were made by M, domestica. All fly
species were more numerous in the wet season than the dry season. Eyes
of young children are considered to be the main reservoir of Chlamydia
trachomatis, the causative agent of trachoma. Collections of eye-seeking
flies from children showed frequent fly-eye contacts (median
{[}interquartile range], 3 {[}1.5-7] every 15 min). Children with
potentially infective ocular or nasal discharge had twice as many
fly-eye contacts than children with no discharge (P < 0.001). There was
no difference in exposure to fly-eye contacts ifa child sat inside or
outside a house (P = 0.273). Female flies were more commonly caught from
eyes than male (P < 0.001). The presence of Chlamydia DNA was
demonstrated by PCR on 2 of 395 flies caught from the eyes of children
with a current active trachoma infection. Both positive flies were M
sorbens, one male and the other female. Further elucidation of M,
sorbens behavioural ecology and the development of sustainable
strategies to control these flies should be a priority. It is likely
that M. sorbens is the principal insect vector of trachoma in The

abstract = {Soil fertility depletion in smallholder agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa presents a formidable challenge both for food production and environmental sustainability. A critical constraint to managing soils in sub-Saharan Africa is poor targeting of soil management interventions. This is partly due to lack of diagnostic tools for screening soil condition that would lead to a robust and repeatable spatially explicit case definition of poor soil condition. The objectives of this study were to: (i) evaluate the ability of near infrared spectroscopy to detect changes in soil properties across a forest-cropland chronosequence; and (ii) develop a heuristic scheme for the application of infrared spectroscopy as a tool for case definition and diagnostic screening of soil condition for agricultural and environmental management. Soil reflectance was measured for 582 topsoil samples collected from forest-cropland chronosequence age classes namely; forest, recently converted, RC (17 years) and historically converted, HC (ca.70 years). 130 randomly selected samples were used to calibrate soil properties to soil reflectance using partial least-squares regression (PLSR). 64 randomly selected samples were withheld for validation. A proportional odds logistic model was applied to chronosequence age classes and 10 principal components of spectral reflectance to determine three soil condition classes namely; “good”, “average” and “poor” for 194 samples. Discriminant analysis was applied to classify the remaining 388 “unknown” samples into soil condition classes using the 194 samples as a training set. Validation r2 values were: total C, 0.91; total N, 0.90; effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), 0.90; exchangeable Ca, 0.85; clay content, 0.77; silt content, 0.77 exchangeable Mg, 0.76; soil pH, 0.72; and K, 0.64. A spectral based definition of “good”, “average” and “poor” soil condition classes provided a basis for an explicitly quantitative case definition of poor or degraded soils. Estimates of probabilities of membership of a sample in a spectral soil condition class presents an approach for probabilistic risk-based assessments of soil condition over large spatial scales. The study concludes that reflectance spectroscopy is rapid and offers the possibility for major efficiency and cost saving, permitting spectral case definition to define poor or degraded soils, leading to better targeting of management interventions.},

In this type of problem it is often necessary to replace the concept of "optimgm" with that of "best compromise". In contrast with methods dealing with a priori weighted sums of the objective functions, the method described here involves a sequential exploration of solutions. This exploration is guided to some extent by the decision maker who intervenes by means of defined responses to precise questions posed by the algorithm. Thus, in this man-model symbiosis, phases of computation alternate with phases of decision. The process allows the decision-maker to "learn" to recognize good solutions and the relative importance of the objectives. The final decision (best compromise) furnished by the man-model system is obtained after a small number of successive phases},

FMC often is overlooked in fuels planning, with default values substituting for more precise estimates, but its role is operationally significant in the selection of silvicultural targets even at modest surface fire intensities. This article discusses the role of FMC in canopy ignition and summarizes the results of 11 studies on the FMC values and trends for 16 North American conifers. FMC values ranged from 73 to 480% but varied by species, foliage age, and season.

Accounting for the existence of stochastic events that generate spatial interactions in the context of a dynamic decision process is crucial for determining optimal management. This paper demonstrates a method for incorporating spatial information and interactions into management decisions made over time. A machine learning technique called approximate dynamic programming is applied to determine the optimal timing and location of fuel treatments and timber harvests for a fire-threatened landscape. Larger net present values can be achieved using policies that explicitly consider evolving spatial interactions created by fire spread, compared to policies that ignore the spatial dimension of the inter-temporal optimization problem.},

abstract = {Neutral landscape models are computer-generated representations of the spatial pattern of habitat. Most are based on a grid of cells, although network (graph theory) representations are increasing. Representation of the landscape varies from binary (habitat – non-habitat) to nearly continuous. The motivations for this approach to the study of landscapes include concepts derived from island biogeography as well as the idea that computer experiments might be substituted for real experiments at such spatial extents. Different spatial patterns can be generated using the three primary algorithms for grid-based neutral landscapes (random, hierarchical, and fractal), while network representations are usually variations on networks derived from observed landscapes. Scale, encompassing both resolution and extent in cellular models as it is in the network models, is an underlying issue that needs to be addressed more explicitly, but it is not a fatal flaw. Numerous applications of neutral landscapes have been developed in assessing actual landscapes, evaluating spatial metrics, and studying landscape connectivity – especially in relation to organism movement or dispersal. Neutral landscapes offer geographers opportunities to pursue spatial questions and to influence questions in landscape ecology.},

patch or cluster of conspecifics-will be most advantageous in landscapes
in which large areas of suitable habitat are consistently available at
long distances from established populations. We review conditions under
which LDD will be selected and conclude that biotic interactions, and in
particular specialized natural enemies, are likely to be one of the most
important factors selecting for LDD in many species. We use simple
spatially implicit and spatially explicit models to illustrate how such
pests affect the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for investment in
LDD. Patches currently occupied by parents are more likely to be
infected than distant, potentially unoccupied,. patches, thus
advantaging dispersal. Patchy infestations also result in higher
variance in reproductive success among patches, which alone selects for
increased among-patch dispersal. Both of these effects increase with the
strength of the impact of infestation, and with the number of species
competing for space in the community. We discuss the potential of
different types of models and analytical tools to capture the impacts of
pests on the evolution of LDD, and conclude that even simple models can
illustrate the general relationship between pest pressure and LDD
advantage, but only spatially explicit simulation models can fully
elucidate the resulting ecological and evolutionary dynamics. In
conclusion, we consider the potential role of selection for LDD in the

abstract = {The Random Forests multiple-regression tree was used to model climate profiles of 25 biotic communities of the western United States and nine of their constituent species. Analyses of the communities were based on a gridded sample of ca. 140,000 points, while those for the species used presence-absence data from ca. 120,000 locations. Independent variables included 35 simple expressions of temperature and precipitation and their interactions. Classification errors for community models averaged 19%, but the errors were reduced by half when adjusted for misalignment between geographic data sets. Errors of omission for species-specific models approached 0, while errors of commission were less than 9%. Mapped climate profiles of the species were in solid agreement with range maps. Climate variables of most importance for segregating the communities were those that generally differentiate maritime, continental, and monsoonal climates, while those of importance for predicting the occurrence of species varied among species but consistently implicated the periodicity of precipitation and temperature-precipitation interactions. Projections showed that unmitigated global warming should increase the abundance primarily of the montane forest and grassland community profiles at the expense largely of those of the subalpine, alpine, and tundra communities but also that of the arid woodlands. However, the climate of 47% of the future landscape may be extramural to contemporary community profiles. Effects projected on the spatial distribution of species-specific profiles were varied, but shifts in space and altitude would be extensive. Species-specific projections were not necessarily consistent with those of their communities.},

This has led many to adopt a generalist stance towards SOC, which is now repeatedly claimed to be a universal theory of complex behaviour. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, I provide a brief and non-technical introduction to SOC. Second, I critically discuss the various bold claims that have been made in connection with it. Throughout, I will adopt a rather sober attitude and argue that some people have been too readily carried away by fancy contentions. My overall conclusion will be that none of these bold claims can be maintained. Nevertheless, stripped of exaggerated expectations and daring assertions, many SOC models are interesting vehicles for promising scientific research. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The contribution of changes in meristem behavior to age-related decline in forest productivity is poorly understood. We studied age-related trends in needle morphology and gas exchange in a population of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) growing in a multi-cohort stand where trees ranged from first-year germinants to trees over 150 years old, as well as in grafted scions from these trees. In the field study, age-related trends in foliar morphology were determined in six cohorts ranging in age from 2 to 120 years, and differences in gas exchange characteristics were compared between 60- and 120-year age classes. In a common-rootstock study, scions from trees representing 20-, 60-, and 120-year cohorts were grafted onto juvenile rootstock and maintained for three growing seasons, after which morphological and physiological foliar attributes were evaluated. The field study revealed significant age-related trends in foliar morphology, including decreasing specific leaf area, and increasing needle width, projected area, and width/length ratio. Similar trends were apparent in foliage from the grafted scions. Both in situ foliage and shoots of grafted scions from the oldest cohort showed significantly lower photosynthetic rates than their counterparts from younger trees; however, differences in stomatal conductance and internal CO(2) concentrations were not significant. These results suggest that: (1) foliage of red spruce exhibits age-related trends in both morphology and physiology; (2) age-related decreases in photosynthetic rates contribute to declining productivity in old red spruce; (3) declines in photosynthetic rates result from nonstomatal limitations; and (4) age-related changes in morphology and physiology are inherent in meristems and persist for at least 3 years in scions grafted to juvenile rootstock.},

abstract = {We built on previous work by performing a more in-depth examination of a completed landscape fuel treatment network. Our specific objectives were: (1) model hazardous fire potential with and without the treatment network, (2) project hazardous fire potential over several decades to assess fuel treatment network longevity, and (3) assess fuel treatment effectiveness and longevity over a range of two critical fire modeling inputs: surface fuel models and canopy base height. Modeling results demonstrate reductions in the hazardous fire potential across much of the treated landscape, relative to the untreated condition. These reductions persist throughout our modeling duration, 2010-2050. However, there was a strong effect of varying ingrowth levels, which were manipulated to generate different estimates of canopy base height over time, on hazardous fire potential over time. Under the low ingrowth level, which resulted in the highest predictions of canopy base height, hazardous fire potential steadily declined over time for the untreated landscape condition. The effect of varying fuel models in treated areas had much less impact on hazardous fire potential, indicating a robust treatment effect. Our results demonstrate a coordinated fuel treatment network that incorporates local knowledge of fire weather and likely fire behavior patterns can have a substantial impact on reducing hazardous fire potential. However, even with planned maintenance of the treatment network, hazard grows in untreated areas over time, resulting in an increase in overall fire hazard. This suggests additional treatments, including fire use, would be necessary to maintain low hazardous fire potential. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

(Franco) var. menziesii) trees. Specific needle area decreased with increasing needle age. The magnitude and rate of change in SNA with needle age were greatest for lower-crown branches, and decreased toward the middle- and upper-crown branches. For all branches, there was no difference between regular and epicormic shoots in the relationship between SNA and needle age. Specific needle area decreased with increasing distance from branch base, and this relationship was significant for the majority of needle age classes of the upper- and middle-crown branches. In the lowercrown branches, SNA did not vary with distance from branch base for the majority of needle age classes. For all branches, there was no difference between regular and epicormic shoots in the relationship between SNA and distance from branch base for the majority of needle age classes. These results indicate that renewal of foliage by epicormic shoot production maintains needle quality. Branch SNA increased linearly with decreasing height in the crown at a mean rate of 0.951 +/- 0.110 cm2 g-1 per vertical meter. Total needle area of branches was estimated from total needle dry weight taking into account within-branch variation in SNA. Analyses of allometric relationships between branch size and foliage amount (needle area and needle dry weight) showed that branch length was a better predictor of foliage amount than branch diameter for old Douglas-fir trees. Total needle dry weight and needle area of the sample trees, estimated from branch length and branch height and taking into account vertical within-crown variation in branch SNA, ranged from 42.4 to 154.2 kg and from 246.2 to 816.0 m2 per tree, respectively.},

abstract = {Model comparisons in ecology are typically conducted in one of two contexts. First, models are compared to data that have already been collected, although comparisons would be more profitable before data collection because gaps could be avoided in the data needed to differentiate among alternate models. In the second context, models are compared for situations where data cannot be obtained (e.g., long-term responses to climate change). These comparisons can build confidence in the model predictions, but only if the models differ in their underlying structure. It is demonstrated that model dynamics are controlled largely by the overall model structure and not by the details of how individual processes are represented. Models structures from the perspective of several resources might all yield similar predictions for slowly changing or steady-state ecosystems because resource cycles tend to synchronize as ecosystems develop. This synchrony is disrupted by perturbations; therefore, models can be more readily differentiated based on their responses to particular disturbances. Time-series techniques can be used compare the dynamic behavior of models. These techniques can yield useful information on how the model structure might be improved. Finally, modeling is put into the broader perspective of the process of ecological science. It is argued that a division of labor is needed that includes expertise in modeling, tool making, and data collection/experimentation.},

However, there is little discussion in the literature about who is the intended benificiary of the intelligence--who is the intended user of the system? In this paper we pay particular attention to identifying the potential users of Intelligen MCDSSs, to identifying their needs and to how the provision of intelligent support can meet these needs. We examine the benefits to be derived from intelligent support and discuss a number of issues prompted by its provision, in particular the question of whether it is feasible or desirable to cater for all potential users of a system.},

abstract = {High-severity wildfires increasingly influence forests in the western United States. Extensive research has identified preventative practices including mechanical and prescribed fire treatments to reduce wildfire severity in mature stands. Yet limited research has investigated fuel management treatments in young stands which can be particularly vulnerable to even low intensity fire. To address this gap, we investigated how prescribed fire (conducted in both the spring and fall) and pre-treatment fuel modifications impacted individual tree damage (or injury) and mortality in nine 13–14 year old mixed conifer stands in the central Sierra Nevada, California, USA. Prior to burning, randomly selected trees were pruned to 1.8 m height above ground. Randomly selected trees were also raked to reduce surrounding surface fuel. Raking fuel from trees reduced the amount of crown volume scorched for all species, but not enough trees died to determine if raking influenced probability of survival. Pruning was associated with reductions in crown consumption height and percent crown volume consumed (5% of crown volume in pruned versus <1% of crown volume unpruned, p = 0.02) but was not a significant predictor of percent of crown volume scorched brown. Pruned trees had only 27% of the mortality of unpruned trees when less than half of the crown was scorched (p = 0.046). However the mortality of pruned trees showed no less sensitivity to fire damage at higher levels of crown scorch (p = 0.0076); in fact extremely scorched trees appeared more likely to die when pruned. Mortality differed strongly by species; giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) showed 97% post-fire survival while nearly half of sugar pines (Pinus lambertiana) died. Fires occurring in spring months killed seven times as many trees as those in autumn months. While the results demonstrate that prescribed burns can be feasible in stands as young as 13 years old, the factors of post-fire damage and mortality are different compared to mature stands. Species composition, pre-fire fuel reduction treatments, and timing of prescribed burns are all important considerations for managers wanting to develop resilient young stands with prescribed fire.},

abstract = {The relative frequencies of functional traits of plant species show notable spatial variation, which is often related to environmental factors. Pollination type (insect-, wind- or self-pollination) is a critical trait for plant reproduction and provision of ecosystem services. Here, we mapped the distribution of pollination types across Germany by combining databases on plant distribution and plant pollination types. Applying a new method, we modelled the composition of pollination types using a set of 12 environmental variables as predictors within a Bayesian framework which allows for the analysis of compositional data in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. A clear biogeographical pattern in the distribution of pollination types was revealed which was adequately captured by our model. The most striking relationship was a relative increase in insect-pollination and a corresponding decrease of selfing with increasing altitude. Further important factors were wind speed, geology and land use. We present a powerful tool to analyse the distribution patterns of plant functional types such as pollination types and their relationship with environmental parameters in a spatially explicit framework.},

@article{Marzloff2013,
abstract = {While they can be useful tools to support decision-making in ecosystem management, robust simulation models of ecosystems with alternative states are challenging to build and validate. Because of the possibility of alternative states in model dynamics, no trivial criteria can provide reliable and useful metrics to assess the goodness-of-fit of such models. This paper outlines the development of the model TRITON, and presents simulation-based validation and analysis of model sensitivity to input parameters. TRITON captures the local dynamics of seaweed-based rocky reef communities in eastern Tasmania, which now occur in two alternative persistent states: (1) either as dense and productive seaweed beds, (2) or as sea urchin ‘barrens' habitat, i.e. bare rock largely denuded of macroalgae and benthic invertebrates due to destructive grazing by sea urchins. Pattern-oriented-modelling, i.e. comparing patterns in model dynamics across Monte–Carlo simulations with direct observations of Tasmanian reef communities over large scales, provides a valuable approach to calibrate the dynamics of TRITON. Using the computationally efficient, model-independent extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test, we identify fishing down of predatory lobsters, sea urchin recruitment rate, as well as seaweed growth rate as key parameters of influence on overall model behaviour. Through a set of independent sensitivity tests, we isolate different sets of drivers facilitating the ‘forward' shift from the seaweed bed to the urchin-dominated state, and the reverse or ‘backward' shift from denuded sea urchin barren to recovery of seaweed cover. The model suggests that rebuilding populations of large rock lobsters, which predate the urchins, will be effective in limiting ongoing formation of sea urchins barrens habitat, but that the chances of restoring seaweed beds from extensive barrens are relatively low if management relies solely on rebuilding stocks of large rock lobsters. Moreover, even when it does occur, seaweed bed restoration takes up to three decades in the simulations and so is arguably unrealistic to implement under short-term fishery management plans. The process of model validation provided both a better understanding of the key drivers of community dynamics (e.g. fishing of predatory lobsters), and an assessment of priority areas for future research.},

abstract = {1. The distribution and abundance of invasive species can be driven by both environmental variables and land management decisions. However, understanding these relationships can be complicated by interactions between management actions and environmental variability, and differences in scale among these variables. The resulting ‘context-dependence' of management actions may be well-appreciated by ecologists and land managers, but can frustrate attempts to apply general management principles. 2. In this study, we quantify the effects of land management and environmental variability at different scales on the occurrence and abundance of Hieracium pilosella, a major agricultural weed in New Zealand. We used a hierarchical study design and analysis to capture relevant scales of variation in management actions and environmental heterogeneity, and test hypotheses about how these factors interact. 3. We show that fertilizing and grazing interact with environmental gradients at the scale of management application (farm paddocks) to influence the establishment and local abundance of H. pilosella. 4. We further show that H. pilosella's relationships with fine-scale abiotic and biotic factors are consistent with expected mechanisms driven by larger-scale management actions. Using data on occurrence and local abundance, we tease apart which factors are important to establishment and subsequent local spread. 5. Synthesis and applications. A major challenge for environmental scientists is to predict how invasive species may respond to ongoing landscape modifications and environmental change. This effort will require approaches to study design and analysis that can accommodate complexities such as interacting management and environmental variables at different scales. Management actions will be more likely to succeed when they explicitly account for variation in environmental context.},

abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events -- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

abstract = {Topography, weather, and fuels are known factors driving fire behavior, but the degree to which each contributes to the spatial pattern of fire severity under different conditions remains poorly understood. The variability in severity within the boundaries of the 2006 wildfires that burned in the Klamath Mountains, northern California, along with data on burn conditions and new analytical tools, pre-sented an opportunity to evaluate factors influencing fire severity under burning conditions representative of those where management of wildfire for resource benefit is most likely. Fire severity was estimated as the percent change in canopy cover (0–100%) classified from the Relativized differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR), and spatial data layers were compiled to determine strength of associations with topogra-phy, weather, and variables directly or indirectly linked to fuels, such as vegetation type, number of previ-ous fires, and time since last fire. Detailed fire progressions were used to estimate weather (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, temperature inversions, and solar radiation) at the time of burning. A gen-eralized additive regression model with random effects and an additional spatial term to account for auto-correlation between adjacent locations was fitted to fire severity. In this fire year characterized by the relative absence of extreme fire weather, topographical complexity most strongly influenced severity. Upper-and mid-slopes tended to burn at higher fire severity than lower-slopes. East-and southeast-facing aspects tended to burn at higher severity than other aspects. Vegetation type and fire history were also important predictors of fire severity. Shrub vegetation was more likely to burn at higher severity than mixed hardwood/conifer or hardwood vegetation. As expected, fire severity was positively associated with time since previous fire, but the relationship was non-linear. Of the weather variables analyzed, tempera-ture inversions, common in the complex topography of the Klamath Mountains, showed the strongest association with fire severity. Inversions trapped smoke and had a dampening effect on severity within the landscape underneath the inversion. Understanding the spatial controls on mixed-severity fires allows managers to better plan for future wildfires and aide in the decision making when managing lightning ignitions for resource benefit might be appropriate.},

The present series of articles endeavours to comprehensively survey and precis all types of surface fire spread models developed during the period 1990-2007. The present paper surveys models of a simulation or mathematical analogue nature. Most simulation models are implementations of existing empirical or quasi-empirical models and their primary function is to convert these generally one-dimensional models to two dimensions and then simulate the propagation of a fire perimeter across a modelled landscape. Mathematical analogue models are those that are based on some mathematical concept (rather than a physical representation of fire spread) that coincidentally represents the spread of fire. Other papers in the series survey models of a physical or quasi-physical nature, and empirical or quasi-empirical nature. Many models are extensions or refinements of models developed before 1990. Where this is the case, these models are also discussed but much less comprehensively.},

We present here an example of an alternative neutral model and hypothesis designed to relate the process of landscape change to observed landscape patterns. The methods and program, QRULE, are described and options for statistical testing outlined. The results show that human fragmentation of landscapes results in a non-random association of land-cover types that can be describe by simple statistical methods. Options for additional landscape studies are discussed and access to QRULE described in the hope that these methods will be employed to advance our understanding of the processes that affect the structure and function in human dominated landscapes.},

abstract = {For some time, ecologists have known that spatial patterns of forest structure reflected disturbance and recovery history, disturbance severity and underlying influences of environmental gradients. In spite of this awareness, historical forest structure has been little used to expand knowledge of historical fire severity. Here, we used forest structure to predict pre-management era fire severity across three biogeoclimatic zones in eastern Washington State, USA, that contained extensive mixed conifer forests. We randomly selected 10% of the subwatersheds in each zone, delineated patch boundaries, and photo-interpreted the vegetation attributes of every patch in each subwatershed using the oldest available stereo-aerial photography. We statistically reconstructed the vegetation of any patch showing evidence of early selective harvesting, and then classified them as to their most recent fire severity. Classification used published percent canopy mortality definitions and a dichotomized procedure that considered the overstory and understory canopy cover and size class attributes of a patch, and the fire tolerance of its cover type. Mixed severity fires were most prevalent, regardless of forest type. The structure of mixed conifer patches, in particular, was formed by a mix of disturbance severities. In moist mixed conifer, stand replacement effects were more widespread in patches than surface fire effects, while in dry mixed conifer, surface fire effects were more widespread by nearly 2:1. However, evidence for low severity fires as the primary influence, or of abundant old park-like patches, was lacking in both the dry and moist mixed conifer forests. The relatively low abundance of old, parklike or similar forest patches, high abundance of young and intermediate-aged patches, and widespread evidence of partial stand and stand-replacing fire suggested that variable fire severity and nonequilibrium patch dynamics were primarily at work.},

abstract = {A mechanistic, biogeochemical succession model, FIRE-BGC, was used to investigate the role of fire on long-term landscape dynamics in northern Rocky Mountain coniferous forests of Glacier National Park, Montana, USA. FIRE-BGC is an individual-tree model--created by merging the gap-phase process-based model FIRESUM with the mechanistic ecosystem biogeochemical model FOREST-BGC--that has mixed spatial and temporal resolution in its simulation architecture. Ecological processes that act at a landscape level, such as fire and seed dispersal, are simulated annually from stand and topographic information. Stand-level processes, such as tree establishment, growth and mortality, organic matter accumulation and decomposition, and undergrowth plant dynamics are simulated both daily and annually. Tree growth is mechanistically modeled based on the ecosystem process approach of FOREST-BGC where carbon is fixed daily by forest canopy photosynthesis at the stand level. Carbon allocated to the tree stem at the end of the year generates the corresponding diameter and height growth. The model also explicitly simulates fire behavior and effects on landscape characteristics. We simulated the effects of fire on ecosystem characteristics of net primary productivity, evapotranspiration, standing crop biomass, nitrogen cycling and leaf area index over 200 years for the 50,000-ha McDonald Drainage in Glacier National Park. Results show increases in net primary productivity and available nitrogen when fires are included in the simulation. Standing crop biomass and evapotranspiration decrease under a fire regime. Shade-intolerant species dominate the landscape when fires are excluded. Model tree increment predictions compared well with field data.},

abstract = {Theory predicts that wildfires will encounter spatial thresholds where different drivers may become the dominant influence on continued fire spread. Studying these thresholds, however, is limited by a lack of sufficiently detailed data sets. To address this problem, we searched for scale thresholds in data describing wildfire size at the Avon Park Air Force Range, south-central Florida. We used power-law statistics to describe the ``heavy-tail{''} of the fire size distribution, and quantile regression to determine how the edges of data distributions of fire size were related to climate. Power-law statistics revealed a heavy-tail, a pattern consistent with scale threshold theory, which predicts that large fires will be rare because only fires that cross all thresholds will become large. Results from quantile regression suggested that different climate conditions served as critical thresholds, influencing wildfire size at different spatial scales. Modeling at higher quantiles (a parts per thousand yen75th) implicated drought as driving the spread of larger fires, whereas modeling at lower quantiles (a parts per thousand currency sign25th) implicated that wind governed the spread of smaller fires. Fires of intermediate size were negatively associated with relative humidity. Our results are consistent with the idea that fire spread involves scale thresholds, with the small-scale drivers allowing fires to spread after ignition, but with further spread only being possible when large-scale drivers are favorable. These results suggest that other data sets that have heavy-tailed distributions may contain patterns generated by scale thresholds, and that these patterns may be revealed using quantile regression.},

The hierarchical scales in our study included fertilization treatments (fertilized and unfertilized), trees within the treatments, and positions within the trees. We measured tracheid diameter, tracheid length, percent latewood, number of pits per cell, density, and specific conductivity (Ks) on seven positions in each of 16 fertilized and 16 unfertilized trees: the trunk at cambial age 52 (breast height), 25, and 5; a branch at cambial age 20 and 7; and a root at cambial age 42 and 22. Vulnerability to embolism was also measured on the oldest trunk, branch, and root positions. For any measurement, there was little variation between treatments, however, there was great variation among positions. Tracheid diameter, tracheid length, number of pits per cell, Ks, and vulnerability to embolism decreased vertically from the roots to the branches. Correlations were evident between some positions for tracheid diameter, percent earlywood, pits per cell, and vulnerability to embolism, mostly in the fertilized treatment. We found evidence for large-scale relationships (among all observations from all trees) between density and tracheid diameter, Ks and diameter, vulnerability and diameter, Ks and pits per cell, and vulnerability and pits per cell. At a smaller scale of within position, however, usually only the branches and roots maintained the relationship.},

abstract = {Functional structural models (FSMs) are valuable tools to explore relationships between plant form and function, yet they lack rigorous methods for development and assessment. We use multi-criteria assessment of an architectural FSM to show that both traumatic sequential and adaptive delayed reiteration (ADR) are necessary components of foliage maintenance in branches of oldgrowth Pseudotsuga menziesii. ADR has previously been established as a process that maintains foliage in oldgrowth P. menziesii. We use a simulation model of branch development in the species to evaluate morphogenesis in the context of this ADR. The structure of the model is a theoretical representation of how P. menziesii branch morphology develops throughout the branch lifespan, and this model structure is assessed with two criteria that are optimized simultaneously; the criteria measure foliage demography by the number of foliated shoots, and how those foliated shoots are organized into independent clusters. Assessment results indicated that improvements in model structure were required. Anomalous parameter vectors from the assessment search uncovered an inadequacy in the process of foliage maintenance, and the model was modified to include traumatic sequential reiteration in addition to ADR. The modes of the resulting parameter distributions were consistent with empirical observations. We discuss why the assessment of FSMs is an essential procedure that requires multiple criteria.},

abstract = {Abstract: To better understand the relationship between wildfire and forest regeneration in the boreal forest, we quantify their degree of relationship by means of correlation. Given that wildfires in the boreal forest can cover large areas, such correlation needs also to be computed for large areas (i.e., 33,000 km2 in northern Qu{\'{e}}bec). At this landscape scale, both variables (fire and forest) show strong and significant positive spatial autocorrelation. The presence of spatial autocorrelation in the two variables, however, can affect the statistical significance and the interpretation of their degree of correlation. In this paper, we compare different approaches that have been proposed to solve this problem: a parametric test that corrects for the presence of autocorrelation by adjusting the effective sample size (Dutilleul's modified t test); a complete randomization test; a restricted randomization test based on a toroidal shift; the Mantel test that controls for the relative spatial locations among sampling; and the partial Mantel test that controls for the spatial distances among sampling sites. A positive correlation between the two variables was found significant by the parametric test and complete randomization test, but not significant when the restricted randomization test, Dutilleul's modified t test, and the Mantel test were used. Conversely, a negative correlation was found by the partial Mantel test. Hence, to control for the presence of spatial autocorrelation, either a restricted randomization test or the Dutilleul method is recommended, while to control for the spatial relative position of the data, the Mantel and partial Mantel tests should be used. A firm understanding of these statistical tests and their respective assumptions regarding the spatial structure of the data is crucial to any valid ecological understanding and interpretation.

Not every forest is at risk of uncharacteristically severe wildfire, but drier forests are in need of active management to mitigate fire hazard. We summarize a set of simple principles important to address in fuel reduction treatments: reduction of surface fuels, increasing the height to live crown, decreasing crown density, and retaining large trees of fire-resistant species. Thinning and prescribed fire can be useful tools to achieve these objectives. Low thinning will be more effective than crown or selection thinning, and management of surface fuels will increase the likelihood that the stand will survive a wildfire. Five empirical examples of such treatment are discussed: Hayfork fires, California, 1987; Tyee fire,Washington, 1994; Megram fire, California, 1999; Hayman fire, Colorado, 2002; and the Cone fire, California, 2002. Applying treatments at an appropriate landscape scale will be critical to the success of fuel reduction treatments in reducing wildfire losses in Western forests.},

abstract = {Wildfire can lead to considerable hydrological and geomorphological change, both directly by weathering bedrock surfaces and changing soil structure and properties, and indirectly through the effects of changes to the soil and vegetation on hydrological and geomorphological processes. This review summarizes current knowledge and identifies research gaps focusing particularly on the contribution of research from the Mediterranean Basin, Australia and South Africa over the last two decades or so to the state of knowledge mostly built on research carried out in the USA. Wildfire-induced weathering rates have been reported to be high relative to other weathering processes in fire-prone terrain, possibly as much as one or two magnitudes higher than frost action, with important implications for cosmogenic-isotope dating of the length of rock exposure. Wildfire impacts on soil properties have been a major focus of interest over the last two decades. Fire usually reduces soil aggregate stability and can induce, enhance or destroy soil water repellency depending on the temperature reached and its duration. These changes have implications for infiltration, overland flow and rainsplash detachment. A large proportion of publications concerned with fire impacts have focused on post-fire soil erosion by water, particularly at small scales. These have shown elevated, sometimes extremely large post-fire losses before geomorphological stability is re-established. Soil losses per unit area are generally negatively related to measurement scale reflecting increased opportunities for sediment storage at larger scales. Over the last 20 years, there has been much improvement in the understanding of the forms, causes and timing of debris flow and landslide activity on burnt terrain. Advances in previously largely unreported processes (e.g. bio-transfer of sediment and wind erosion) have also been made. Post-fire hydrological effects have generally also been studied at small rather than large scales, with soil water repellency effects on infiltration and overland flow being a particular focus. At catchment scales, post-fire accentuated peakflow has received more attention than changes in total flow, reflecting easier measurement and the greater hazard posed by the former. Post-fire changes to stream channels occur over both short and long terms with complex feedback mechanisms, though research to date has been limited. Research gaps identified include the need to: (1) develop a fire severity index relevant to soil changes rather than to degree of biomass destruction; (2) isolate the hydrological and geomorphological impacts of fire-induced soil water repellency changes from other important post-fire changes (e.g. litter and vegetation destruction); (3) improve knowledge of the hydrological and geomorphological impacts of wildfire in a wider range of fire-prone terrain types; (4) solve important problems in the determination and analysis of hillslope and catchment sediment yields including poor knowledge about soil losses other than at small spatial and short temporal scales, the lack of a clear measure of the degradational significance of post-fire soil losses, and confusion arising from errors in and lack of scale context for many quoted post-fire soil erosion rates; and (5) increase the research effort into past and potential future hydrological and geomorphological changes resulting from wildfire. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

disturbance and how ecosystems respond to disturbance. This omission may
bias perceptions about the impact of disturbance. Human impacts, such as
timber harvesting, are often deterministic, with disturbance occurring
at prescribed intervals, at a single spatial scale, and at a single

different impacts from natural stochastic processes that operate at

to describe disturbance in terms of mean values such as frequency,
because variation around the mean is important for determining the
impact of disturbance. Uncertainty is ubiquitous in natural systems and
the importance of including uncertainty in forest management is
discussed. Methods are described for integrating uncertainty of various

abstract = {I evaluated the habitat use of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann) in a boreal mixedwood forest managed for timber production in northern Saskatchewan, Canada, to determine which kinds of factors (e.g., forage abundance, canopy cover) influenced habitat use, if white-tailed deer considered these habitat factors in isolation or instead there was evidence of trade-offs, and whether the identification of the factors or the way in which they were traded off varied subsequent to the introduction of harvested patches or changes in hunting traffic. Habitat use was estimated through ground-based surveys before and after the elimination of hunting traffic in a partially harvested site and before and after harvesting in a formerly hunted but unharvested site. Forage abundance was always a significant, or marginally significant, predictor of habitat use. Canopy cover was only important in sites with limited water access. In the presence of hunting traffic, white-tailed deer balanced multiple habitat factors (e.g., food access vs. road avoidance); when hunting traffic was eliminated, the trade-off behaviour was abandoned. The variety in behaviour that the white-tailed deer exhibited in my study implies that to successfully protect habitat, it may not be sufficient to simply identify the factors that influence habitat use (and presumably value). We may also need to understand how the animals deal with these factors under different conditions.},

abstract = {Wildfire risks for California under four climatic change scenarios were statistically modeled as functions of climate, hydrology, and topography. Wildfire risks for the GFDL and PCM global climate models and the A2 and B1 emissions scenarios were compared for 2005–2034, 2035–2064, and 2070–2099 against a modeled 1961–1990 reference period in California and neighboring states. Outcomes for the GFDL model runs, which exhibit higher temperatures than the PCM model runs, diverged sharply for different kinds of fire regimes, with increased temperatures promoting greater large fire frequency in wetter, forested areas, via the effects of warmer temperatures on fuel flammability. At the same time, reduced moisture availability due to lower precipitation and higher temperatures led to reduced fire risks in some locations where fuel flammability may be less important than the availability of fine fuels. Property damages due to wildfires were also modeled using the 2000 U.S. Census to describe the location and density of residential structures. In this analysis the largest changes in property damages under the climate change scenarios occurred in wildland/urban interfaces proximate to major metropolitan areas in coastal southern California, the Bay Area, and in the Sierra foothills northeast of Sacramento.},

abstract = {The strategy of managing for ``natural{''} patterns towards ecological
sustainability of forests is currently limited to simple spatial
attributes of landscapes. Yet, there is general agreement that
landscapes are highly dynamic entities suggesting that temporal patterns
may also be important. This study used historical estimates of 20-yr
disturbance rates, and a spatially explicit, stochastic landscape model
to create multiple possible landscape mosaic scenes for three different
landscapes in the foothills of Alberta. The results were summarized as
frequency distributions by age-class, and the distributions compared to
the percentage of area in the current, and the pre-commercial
landscapes. Results indicated that aside from one age-class in one of
the landscapes, both current and pre-commercial age-class distributions
were well within the historical ranges suggested by the simulations.
More generally, the simulations indicated relatively high, but landscape
specific, levels of historical temporal variability. This implies that
there are patterns to temporal variability which may be captured,
quantified. and emulated as alternatives to single age-class management
targets. The research also demonstrates a method of assessing age-class
distributions within the context of historical ranges of distributions.},

abstract = {The growth pattern was analyzed for Abies mariesii Mast. saplings in the subalpine climax forests of the northern Yatsugatake Mountains, central Japan. The lateral branches were distinguished from the trunk not only with respect to the branching habits and needle arrangement but also with respect to the distribution of dry matter to needles, the slenderness of shoot-stem and the longevity of needles on them. Based on these differences, the contribution of the trunk and lateral branches to the matter production function of saplings is discussed. The lateral branches showed plastic changes in their growth characters in order to expand and maintain an assimilation system effectively, under conditions of suppression. In addition, the trunk growth was inhibited compared with the lateral branch growth and the apical dominance among lateral branches was weakened in the suppressed saplings. It was concluded that these growth habits resulted in the observed difference in the crown shape of saplings in the different habitats. Arguments are presented regarding the adaptive meanings of such a growth pattern for the shade tolerance and survival of the saplings and for the regeneration of the forests.},

Experimentally, these fluxes can be measured by 13C-flux analysis, and there has been a long-standing interest in understanding this functional network operation from an evolutionary perspective. On the basis of 13C-determined fluxes from nine bacteria and multi-objective optimization theory, we show that metabolism operates close to the Pareto-optimal surface of a three-dimensional space defined by competing objectives. Consistent with flux data from evolved Escherichia coli, we propose that flux states evolve under the trade-off between two principles: optimality under one given condition and minimal adjustment between conditions. These principles form the forces by which evolution shapes metabolic fluxes in microorganisms' environmental context.},

abstract = {Wildland-urban interfaces (WUIs) are areas where urban settlements and wildland vegetation intermingle, making the interaction between human activities and wildlife especially intense. Their relevance is increasing worldwide as they are expanding and are associated with fire risk. The WUI may affect the fire risk associated with the type of vegetation (land cover/land use; LULC), a well-known risk factor, due to differences in the type and intensity of human activities in different LULCs within and outside WUIs. No previous studies analyse this interaction between the effects of the WUI and the LULC, despite its importance for understanding the patterns of fire risk, an essential prerequisite to undertake management decisions that can influence fire regimes. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of the WUI on fire ignition risk and the area burned, and the interaction between its effect and that of the LULC. We used a database of 26,838 wildfires recorded in 2006-2011 in NW Spain and compared fire patterns in relation to WUI and LULC with a random model, using a Montecarlo approach. There was a clear effect of the WUI on the risk of both fire ignition and spread (higher ignition risk but lower risk of spread in WUIs). The risk of fire was also affected by LULC and, interestingly, the pattern among LULCs differed between WUI and non-WUI areas. This interaction WUI × LULC was particularly important for forestry plantations, which showed the highest increase in ignition risk in WUI compared to non-WUI areas. Native forests and agricultural areas had the lowest ignition risk. Agricultural areas showed the smallest difference in fire size between WUI and non-WUI areas, while shrublands showed much larger fires outside WUIs. Deliberate fires were larger in general than those with other causes, especially outside the WUI. The differences found between LULCs in fire risk, both in WUI and non-WUI areas, have interesting implications for fire management. Promotion of land covers with low fire risk should be considered as a low cost alternative to the usual fire prevention measures based on fuel load reduction, which require the continuous clearing of vegetation. In this regard, the low fire risk in native forests should be taken into account. Native forests naturally colonize many areas in the study region and require low or no management, in contrast with agricultural areas, also with low fire risk but requiring continuous management in order to avoid colonization by natural vegetation.},

abstract = {Our objective was to infer the controls of spatial variation in historical fire regimes. We reconstructed a multicentury history of fire frequency, size, season, and severity from fire scars and establishment dates of 1426 trees sampled on grids in four watersheds (∼64 plots, over ∼1620 ha each) representative of the Blue Mountains, Oregon and Washington, USA. The influence of regional climate, a top-down control, was inferred from among-watershed variation in fire regimes, while the influence of local topography, a bottom-up control, was inferred from within-watershed variation. Before about 1900, fire regimes varied among and within watersheds, suggesting that both top-down and bottom-up controls were important. At the regional scale, dry forests (dominated by ponderosa pine), burned twice as frequently and earlier in the growing season in southern watersheds than in northern watersheds, consistent with longer and drier fire seasons to the south. Mesic forests (dominated by subalpine fir or grand fir) probably also burned more frequently to the south. At the local scale, fire frequency varied with different parameters of topography in watersheds with steep terrain, but not in the watershed with gentle terrain. Frequency varied with aspect in watersheds where topographic facets are separated by significant barriers to fire spread, but not in watersheds where such facets interfinger without fire barriers. Frequency varied with elevation where elevation and aspect interact to create gradients in snow-cover duration and also where steep talus interrupts fuel continuity. Frequency did not vary with slope within any watershed. The presence of both regional-scale and local-scale variation in the Blue Mountains suggests that top-down and bottom-up controls were both important and acted simultaneously to influence fire regimes in the past. However, an abrupt decline in fire frequency around 1900 was much greater than any regional or local variation in the previous several centuries and indicates that 20th-century fire regimes in these watersheds were dramatically affected by additional controls such as livestock grazing and fire suppression. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of examining spatial variation in historical fire regimes across scales as a means for inferring their controls.},

To date, such scenarios have not adequately examined crucial possibilities, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, and have relied on research processes that slowed the exchange of information among physical, biological and social scientists.

Our focus is on systems which are optimized, either through natural selection or engineering design, to provide robust performance despite uncertain environments. We suggest that power laws in these systems are due to tradeoffs between yield, cost of resources, and tolerance to risks. These tradeoffs lead to highly optimized designs that allow for occasional large events. We investigate the mechanism in the context of percolation and sand pile models in order to emphasize the sharp contrasts between HOT and self-organized criticality (SOC), which has been widely suggested as the origin for power laws in complex systems. Like SOC, HOT produces power laws. However, compared to SOC, HOT states exist for densities which are higher than the critical density, and the power laws are not restricted to special values of the density. The characteristic features of HOT systems include: (1) high efficiency, performance, and robustness to designed-for uncertainties; (2) hypersensitivity to design flaws and unanticipated perturbations; (3) nongeneric, specialized, structured configurations; and (4) power laws. The first three of these are in contrast to the traditional hallmarks of criticality, and are obtained by simply adding the element of design to percolation and sand pile models, which completely changes their characteristics.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to identify land-cover types where fire incidence is higher (preferred) or lower (avoided) than expected from a random null model. Fire selectivity may be characterized by the number of fires expected in a given land-cover class and by the mean surface area each fire will burn. These two components of fire pattern are usually independent of each other. For instance, fire number is usually connected with socioeconomic causes whereas fire size is largely controlled by fuel continuity. Therefore, on the basis of available fire history data for Sardinia (Italy) for the period 2000-2004 we analyzed fire selectivity of given land-cover classes keeping both variables separate from each other. The results obtained from analysis of 13,377 fires show that for most land-cover classes fire behaves selectively, with marked preference (or avoidance) in terms of both fire number and fire size. Fire number is higher than expected by chance alone in urban and agricultural areas. In contrast, in forests, grasslands, and shrublands, fire number is lower than expected. In grasslands and shrublands mean fire size is significantly larger than expected from a random null model whereas in urban areas, permanent crops, and heterogeneous agricultural areas there is significant resistance to fire spread. Finally, as concerns mean fire size, in our study area forests and arable land burn in proportion to their availability without any significant tendency toward fire preference or avoidance. The results obtained in this study contribute to fire risk assessment on the landscape scale, indicating that risk of wildfire is closely related to land cover.},
annote = {Interesting note in the middle of the discussion--large fires are driven by severe weather conditions, reducing the role of landscape structure (true), so the behavior of large fires approximates standard percolation model in which broad-scale cumulative effects of interacting features (terrain, vegetation, etc.) can be effectively modeled by random probability assignments. (paraphrasing and some quoting there).


So, we don't need to model landscape structure explicitly because we can represent those features more broadly and stochastically. Not sure if I agree with the reference to percolation in that case.},

The system is designed to accommodate researchers and managers operating at a variety of scales, and who have access to a variety of kinds of input data. Users can generate fuel characteristics by accessing existing fuelbed descriptions (fuelbed prototypes) using generic information such as cover type or vegetation form. Fuelbed prototypes will provide the best available predictions of the kind, quality and abundance of fuels. Users can accept these default settings or modify some or all of them using more detailed information about vegetation structure and fuel biomass. When the user has completed editing the fuelbed data, the FCC system calculates or infers quantitative fuel characteristics (physical, chemical, and structural properties) and probable fire parameters specific to that fuelbed. Each user-described fuelbed is also assigned to one of approximately 192 stylized fuel characteristic classes.},

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis (SA) can aid in identifying influential model parameters and optimizing model structure, yet infectious disease modelling has yet to adopt advanced SA techniques that are capable of providing considerable insights over traditional methods. We investigate five global SA methods--scatter plots, the Morris and Sobol' methods, Latin hypercube sampling-partial rank correlation coefficient and the sensitivity heat map method--and detail their relative merits and pitfalls when applied to a microparasite (cholera) and macroparasite (schistosomaisis) transmission model. The methods investigated yielded similar results with respect to identifying influential parameters, but offered specific insights that vary by method. The classical methods differed in their ability to provide information on the quantitative relationship between parameters and model output, particularly over time. The heat map approach provides information about the group sensitivity of all model state variables, and the parameter sensitivity spectrum obtained using this method reveals the sensitivity of all state variables to each parameter over the course of the simulation period, especially valuable for expressing the dynamic sensitivity of a microparasite epidemic model to its parameters. A summary comparison is presented to aid infectious disease modellers in selecting appropriate methods, with the goal of improving model performance and design.},

abstract = {Many hypotheses have been advanced about factors that control tree longevity. We use a simulation model with multi-criteria optimization and Pareto optimality to determine branch morphologies in the Pinaceae that minimize the effect of growth limitations due to water stress while simultaneously maximizing carbohydrate gain. Two distinct branch morphologies in the Pareto optimal space resemble Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco and Abies grandis (Dougl. ex D. Don) Lindl., respectively. These morphologies are distinguished by their performance with respect to two pathways of compensation for hydraulic limitation: minimizing the mean path length to terminal foliage (Pseudotsuga) and minimizing the mean number of junction constrictions to terminal foliage (Abies). Within these two groups, we find trade-offs between the criteria for foliage display and the criteria for hydraulic functioning, which shows that an appropriate framework for considering tree longevity is how trees compensate, simultaneously, for multiple stresses. The diverse morphologies that are found in a typical old-growth conifer forest may achieve compensation in different ways. The method of Pareto optimization that we employ preserves all solutions that are successful in achieving different combinations of criteria. The model for branch development that we use simulates the process of delayed adaptive reiteration (DAR), whereby new foliage grows from suppressed buds within the established branch structure. We propose a theoretical synthesis for the role of morphology in the persistence of old Pseudotsuga based on the characteristics of branch morphogenesis found in branches simulated from the optimal set. (i) The primary constraint on branch growth for Pseudotsuga is the mean path length; (ii) as has been previously noted, DAR is an opportunistic architecture; and (iii) DAR is limited by the number of successive reiterations that can form. We show that Pseudotsuga morphology is not the only solution to old-growth constraints, and we suggest how the model results should be used to guide future empirical investigation based on the two contrasting morphologies and how the morphological contrast may relate to physiological processes. Our results show that multi-criteria optimization with Pareto optimality has promise to advance the use of models in theory development and in exploration of functional-structural trade-offs, particularly in complex biological systems with multiple limiting factors.},

abstract = {A revised set of propositions about ecology in arid Australia is
presented, based on research literature since publication of Stafford
Smith and Morton (1990). Fourteen propositions distil our argument that
most features of the Australian deserts are explicable in terms of two
dominant physical and climatic elements: rainfall variability, leading
to extended droughts and occasional flooding rains; and widespread
nutrient poverty. Different landscapes within the arid zone show these
features to varying degrees, and so it is important to think about
different places separately when considering our propositions. Plant
life-histories strongly reflect temporal patterns of soil moisture;
because Australian deserts receive more variable rainfall than most
others, there is a distinctive spectrum of life-histories. Low levels
of phosphorus (together with abundant soil moisture on irregular
occasions) favour plants producing a relative excess of carbohydrate
(C). In turn, C-rich plant products sometimes lead to fire-prone
ecosystems, assemblages dominated by consumers of sap and other C-based
products, and abundant detritivores (particularly termites).
Fluctuations in production due to variable rainfall provide openings
for consumers with opportunistic life-histories, including inhabitants
of extensive but ephemeral rivers and lakes. Most consumer species
exhibit some dietary flexibility or utilise more dependable resources:
these strategies give rise to greater stability in species dynamics and
composition of assemblages than might first be imagined under the
variable rainfall regime. Aboriginal people have had long-standing
ecological influence as they accessed resources. For each proposition
we suggest the extent to which it is `different', `accentuated' or
`universal' in comparison with other deserts of the world, recognising
that this categorisation is in need of critical testing. Further tests
of each proposition are also suggested to fill the many gaps that still
exist in our knowledge of the structure and functioning of Australia's
deserts. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Fire was arguably the most important forest and rangeland disturbance process in the Inland Northwest United States for millennia. Prior to the Lewis and Clark expedition, fire regimes ranged from high severity with return intervals of one to five centuries, to low severity with fire-free periods lasting three decades or less. Indoamerican burning contributed to the fire ecology of grasslands and lower and mid-montane dry forests, especially where ponderosa pine was the dominant overstory species, but the extent of this contribution is difficult to quantify. Two centuries of settlement, exploitation, management, and climate variation have transformed the fire regimes, vegetation and fuel patterns, and overall functionality of these forests. We present a narrative that portrays conditions beginning at the first contact of Euro-American settlers with Indoamericans of the region and extending to the present. Due in part to its geographic isolation, the Inland Northwest was among the last regions to be discovered by Euro-Americans. In 200 years the region has undergone fur trapping and trading, sheep, cattle, and horse grazing, timber harvesting, mining, road construction, native grassland conversion to agricultural production, urban and rural area development, fire prevention, and fire suppression. We highlight key changes to forest landscape patterns and processes that occurred under these combined influences, discuss implications of the changes, and progress towards restoring sustainability. An adaptive ecosystem management model has been adopted by public land management agencies to remedy current conditions. Ecosystem management is a relatively new concept that emphasizes the integrity and sustainability of land systems rather than outputs from the land. Adaptive management emphasizes the twin notions that incomplete knowledge and high degrees of risk and uncertainty about earth and climate systems will always limit land and resource planning and management decisions, and that management is chiefly a learning and adapting process. We discuss current issues and future options associated with ecosystem management, including the low likelihood of social consensus concerning desired outcomes, the lack of integrated planning, analysis, and decision support tools, and mismatches between existing land management planning processes, Congressional appropriations, and complex management and restoration problems.},

abstract = {The purpose of this work is to understand the nature of growth–climate relationships for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) across the climatic dimensions of its niche. We used a combination of biophysically informed sampling (to identify sample sites) and dendroclimatology (to identify growth–climate relationships) along a climate gradient in northwestern United States mountain ecosystems from the western Olympic Peninsula, Washington to the eastern Rocky Mountain Front, Montana. We used a multi-scale sampling strategy that accounted for continentality, physiography, and topography as non-climatic factors that could influence climate and alter tree growth. We developed a network of 124 Douglas-fir tree-ring chronologies and explored growth–climate correlations across the sampled gradients. We considered two different spatial scales of monthly and seasonal climate variables as potential controlling factors on tree growth. Annual radial growth in 60–65% of the plots across the region is significantly correlated with precipitation, drought, or water balance during the late summer prior to growth and the early summer the year of growth. In a few plots, growth is positively correlated with cool-season temperature or negatively correlated with snowpack. Water availability is therefore more commonly limiting to Douglas-fir growth than energy limitations on growing season length. The first principal component derived from the chronologies is significantly correlated with independent drought reconstructions. The sensitivity of Douglas-fir to summer water balance deficit (potential evapotranspiration minus actual evapotranspiration) indicates that increases in April to September temperature without increases in summer precipitation or soil moisture reserves are likely to cause decreases in growth over much of the sampled area, especially east of the Cascade crest. In contrast, Douglas-fir may exhibit growth increases at some higher elevation sites where seasonal photosynthesis is currently limited by growing-season length or low growing-season temperature. Life-history processes such as establishment, growth, and mortality are precursors to changes in biogeography, and measurements of climate effects on those processes can provide early indications of climate-change effects on ecosystems.},

abstract = {Recent research has concluded that forest wildfires in the western United States are becoming larger and more frequent. A more significant question may be whether the ecosystem impacts of wildfire are also increasing. We show that a large area (approximately 120000 km2) of California and western Nevada experienced a notable increase in the extent of forest stand-replacing (“high severity”) fire between 1984 and 2006. High severity forest fire is closely linked to forest fragmentation, wildlife habitat availability, erosion rates and sedimentation, post-fire seedling recruitment, carbon sequestration, and various other ecosystem properties and processes. Mean and maximum fire size, and the area burned annually have also all risen substantially since the beginning of the 1980s, and are now at or above values from the decades preceding the 1940s, when fire suppression became national policy. These trends are occurring in concert with a regional rise in temperature and a long-term increase in annual precipitation. A close examination of the climate–fire relationship and other evidence suggests that forest fuels are no longer limiting fire occurrence and behavior across much of the study region. We conclude that current trends in forest fire severity necessitate a re-examination of the implications of all-out fire suppression and its ecological impacts.},

abstract = {Fuel loads in forest areas are dependent on vegetation type and the time since the last fire. This paper reports a study on the feasibility of using remotely sensed data to estimate vegetative fuel loads. It describes two methods for estimating fuel loads using Landsat TM data based on equations describing litter accumulation and decomposition. The first method uses classification techniques to predict vegetation types coupled with fire history data to derive current fuel loads. The second method applies a canopy turnover rate to estimate litterfall and subsequently accumulated litter from biomass, thus utilising the dominant influence of canopy on remotely sensed data. Both methods are compared with data collected from Popran National Park in coastal New South Wales. The amounts of litter calculated with the biomass method were similar to field results, but the classification method was found to overestimate fuel loads. A sensitivity analysis investigated the impact of varying the vegetation constants and rates used in the fuel estimates to simulate uncertainty or error in their values. The biomass method was less subject to uncertainties and has potential for estimating fuel quantities to provide useful spatial information for fire managers.},
annote = {This study describes how fuel loads in forest areas are dependent on the type of vegetation and the time since the last fire. Brandis and Jacobson go on in the introduction to say that vegetative fuel load information is important because fire managers need to be able to quantify the amount of fuel the fire has available to burn. This study also refers to a study about the feasibility of remote sensing to estimate fuel loads. One of Brandis and Jacobson's conclusions were that if fire history data is present it is possible to estimate fuel loads from remotely sensed data. Using Conroy's equation in predicting biomass turnover, the fuel quantities were closer to the actual quantities. They concluded that this would have potential to measure loads in remote and rugged locations. Accuracy of fuel load estimates would be improved if there were better estimates of vegetation data. Remote sensing has advantages over the current methods like; time in the field would be reduced, data for remote areas could be obtained, and imagery could provide a range of other related information.},

abstract = {The existence of true scale-invariance in slowly driven models of self-organized criticality without a conservation law, such as forest-fires or earthquake automata, is scrutinized in this paper. By using three different levels of description-(i) a simple mean field, (ii) a more detailed mean-field description in terms of a (self-organized) branching processes, and (iii) a full stochastic representation in terms of a Langevin equation-it is shown on general grounds that non-conserving dynamics does not lead to bona. de criticality. Contrary to the case for conserving systems, a parameter, which we term the 're-charging' rate (e. g. the tree-growth rate in forest-fire models), needs to be. ne-tuned in non-conserving systems to obtain criticality. In the infinite-size limit, such a. ne-tuning of the loading rate is easy to achieve, as it emerges by imposing a second separation of timescales but, for any finite size, a precise tuning is required to achieve criticality and a coherent finite-size scaling picture. Using the approaches above, we shed light on the common mechanisms by which 'apparent criticality' is observed in non-conserving systems, and explain in detail (both qualitatively and quantitatively) the difference with respect to true criticality obtained in conserving systems. We propose to call this self-organized quasi-criticality (SOqC). Some of the reported results are already known and some of them are new. We hope that the unified framework presented here will help to elucidate the confusing and contradictory literature in this field. In a forthcoming paper, we shall discuss the implications of the general results obtained here for models of neural avalanches in neuroscience for which self-organized scale-invariance in the absence of conservation has been claimed.},

To be critical, not only power-law but also finite-size scaling (measurements at various system sizes (scales) can be related to each other by re-scaling variables and quantitites in some specific scale-invariant way (i.e. scaling collapses can be performed))(??)


SOC: in nature, many systems when pushed/driven slowly respond irregularly with rapid rearrangements. regarded as "metaphors". Some type of energy or stress is progressively injected in discrete units at the sites of a spatially extended system at a slow time scale. Whenever a certain threshold of local energy is overcome, the site becomes unstable and its accumulated energy is redistributed at a much faster timescale among its neighbor sites. Local redustribution rules are conserving in sandpiles--energy doesn't disappear, it diffuses around. Continue until statistically steady-state
"...any degree of bulk dissipation breaks criticality in sandpile models"
Earthquake and forest fire models are non-conserving self-organized models. the existence of true generic scale-invariance in them has been controversial. "apparent scale-invariance", "dirty criticality"


Kinouchi and Prado introduced term "robust criticality" or "almost criticality". "For a fixed dissipation rate, systems with a loading mechanism are closer to criticality than systems without it." because moderate loading partially compensates energy dissipation


In forest fire models, some similarities with standard percolation models suggested.


"For dissipative systems with a loading term, the dynamics is found to hover around a critical point, with large excursions into the absorbing and and the propagating phases, which do not disappear in the large system size limit. Therefore such systems are not generally critical. Still, some traits of the underlying dynamical percolation critical point can be observed..."


Conserving dynamics is a necessary condition for observing self-organization to criticality. "self-organized quasi-criticality"
for a broad range of parameters, non-conserving systems can be fluctuating in the vicinity of a critical point, but not at the critical point.


Whether to call these systems critical is "a matter of taste"

However, RHESSys has not previously been applied to semiarid shrubland watersheds. In this study, the hydrologic submodel of RHESSys is evaluated by comparing model predictions of monthly and annual streamflow to stream gage data and by comparing RHESSys behavior to that of another hydrologic model of similar complexity, MIKESHE, for a 34 km2 watershed near Santa Barbara, California. In model intercomparison, the differences in predictions of temporal patterns in streamflow, sensitivity of model predictions to calibration parameters and landscape representation, and differences in model estimates of soil moisture patterns are explored. Results from this study show that both models adequately predict seasonal patterns of streamflow response relative to observed data, but differ significantly in terms of estimates of soil moisture patterns and sensitivity of those patterns to the scale of landscape tessellation used to derive spatially distributed elements. This sensitivity has implications for implementing RHESSys as a tool to investigate interactions between hydrology and ecosystem processes.},

abstract = {Modeling the contagious distribution of vegetation and species in
ecology and biogeography has been a challenging issue. Previous studies
have demonstrated that the autologistic regression model is a useful
approach for describing the distribution because spatial correlation can
readily be accounted for in the model. So far studies have been mainly
restrained to the first-order autologistic model. However, the
first-order correlation model may sometimes be insufficient as
long-range dispersal/migration can play a significant role in species
distribution. In this study, we used the second-order autologistic
regression model to model the distributions of the subarctic evergreen
woodland and the boreal evergreen forest in British Columbia, Canada, in
terms of climate covariates. We investigated and compared three
estimation methods for the second-order model-the maximum
pseudo-likelihood method, the Monte Carlo likelihood method, and the
Markov chain Monte Carlo stochastic approximation. Detailed procedures
for these methods were developed and their performances were evaluated
through simulations. The study demonstrates the importance for including
the second-order correlation in the autologistic model for modeling
vegetation distribution at the large geographical scale; each of the two
vegetations studied was strongly autocorrelated not only in the
south-north direction but also in the northwest-southeast direction. The
study further concluded that the assessment of climate change should be
performed on the basis of individual vegetation or species because
different vegetation or species likely respond differently to different
sets of climate variables.},

abstract = {An assessment of the relative importance of vegetation change and disturbance as agents of landscapechange under current and future climates would (1) provide insight into the controls of landscape dynam-ics, (2) help inform the design and development of coarse scale spatially explicit ecosystem models suchas Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), and (3) guide future land management and planning.However, quantification of landscape change from vegetation development and disturbance effects isdifficult because of the large space and long time scales involved. Comparative simulation modelingexperiments, using a suite of models to simulate a set of scenarios, can provide a platform for investigat-ing landscape change over more ecologically appropriate time and space scales that control vegetationand disturbance. We implemented a multifactorial simulation experiment using five landscape fire suc-cession models to explore the role of fire and vegetation development under various climates on a neutrallandscape. The simulation experiment had four factors with two or three treatments each: (1) fire (fireand no fire), (2) succession (dynamic and static succession), (3) climate (historical, warm-wet, warm-dry), and (4) weather (constant, variable). We found that, under historical climates, succession changedmore area annually than fire by factors of 1.2 to 34, but one model simulated more landscape changefrom fire (factor of 0.1). However, we also found that fire becomes more important in warmer futureclimates with factors decreasing to below zero for most models. We also found that there were few dif-ferences in simulation results between weather scenarios with low or high variability. Results from thisstudy show that there will be a shift from vegetation processes that control today's landscape dynamicsto fire processes under future warmer and drier climates, and this shift means that detailed representa-tions of both succession and fire should be incorporated into models to realistically simulate interactionsbetween disturbance and vegetation.},

@article{Wiegand2008,
abstract = {The self-thinning line is a very robust pattern, which can be obtained in modeling studies by a variety of different mechanistic assumptions. Our opinion is that we can only advance in our understanding of mechanisms leading to the self-thinning relationship if we demand that the model also reproduces several other characteristic features (patterns) of the self-thinning process such as the degree of size inequality and the average size. We use a pattern-oriented modeling approach to develop a model of self-thinning under size inequality in overcrowded, even-aged stands, which reproduces these three patterns simultaneously. Our approach is to first develop an initial model based on our current ecological knowledge and then to refine the model by modifying the initial model to derive the model that reproduces all patterns of interest. The initial model is as simple as possible while avoiding incidental, ecologically unjustified, assumptions. It is a further development of zone of influence-simulation models: each plant is described by two circles, one describing a minimum-domain-area and one describing the zone of influence. In the initial model, mortality is "death-by-contact" of minimum-domain-areas and growth is a function of inter-tree competition, i.e. overlapping zones of influence. Model parameterization is based on field data on Acacia reficiens in southern Africa. Simulations follow patches of initially small trees through time for up to 1000 years with five parameters, three describing growth and two describing inter-tree competition. A sensitivity analysis shows that all parameters of the initial model contribute significantly to the number and size of plants through time. The two competition parameters, which describe competitive asymmetry and the size of the zone of influence relative to canopy size, are both important for generating size inequality. Thus, both competitive asymmetry and spatial pattern contribute to size inequality, and their relative importance may vary greatly. The sensitivity analysis suggests that all processes included in the initial model are essential to the evolution of size inequality. However, size inequality under the initial model is below field values, meaning that additional, as yet unconsidered processes, contribute to size inequality. Our best-fit model additionally contains details on growth stochasticity. This study establishes the often-proposed direct link between mortality driven by local competition and self-thinning and highlights the importance of stochasticity in ecological processes. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {To examine the predictability of leaf physiology and biochemistry from light gradients within canopies, we measured photosynthetic light-response curves, leaf mass per area (LMA) and concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorophyll at 15-20 positions within canopies of three conifer species with increasing shade tolerance, ponderosa pine [Pinus ponderosa (Laws.)], Douglas fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France], and western hemlock [Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.]. Adjacent to each sampling position, we continuously monitored photosynthetically active photon flux density (PPFD) over a 5-week period using quantum sensors. From these measurements we calculated FPAR: integrated PPFD at each sampling point as a fraction of full sun. From the shadiest to the brightest canopy positions, LMA increased by about 50% in ponderosa pine and 100% in western hemlock; Douglas fir was intermediate. Canopy-average LMA increased with decreasing shade tolerance. Most foliage properties showed more variability within and between canopies when expressed on a leaf area basis than on a leaf mass basis, although the reverse was true for chlorophyll. Where foliage biochemistry or physiology was correlated with FPAR, the relationships were non-linear, tending to reach a plateau at about 50% of full sunlight. Slopes of response functions relating physiology and biochemistry to ln(FPAR) were not significantly different among species except for the light compensation point, which did not vary in response to light in ponderosa pine, but did in the other two species. We used the physiological measurements for Douglas fir in a model to simulate canopy photosynthetic potential (daily net carbon gain limited only by PPFD) and tested the hypothesis that allocation of carbon and nitrogen is optimized relative to PPFD gradients. Simulated photosynthetic potential for the whole canopy was slightly higher (<10%) using the measured allocation of C and N within the canopy compared with no stratification (i.e., all foliage identical). However, there was no evidence that the actual allocation pattern was optimized on the basis of PPFD gradients alone; simulated net carbon assimilation increased still further when even more N and C were allocated to high-light environments at the canopy top.},

abstract = {Dry site forests in the eastern Cascade Range in Washington were historically maintained on the landscape by a combination of low-intensity and mixed-severity fi res whose frequent occur- rence generally prevented the extensive establishment of high densities of small trees, including fi re intolerant species. Fire suppression over the last century has altered tree species composition and forest structure at stand and landscape levels. Prior to the onset of fi re suppression, dry forests in the eastern Cascade Range were characterized by the presence of fi re refugia embedded within a matrix of dry, open-grown forest often dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa); some of these refugia of closed-canopy, mixed coniferous forests likely supported Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina). The effects of fi re suppression have resulted in the presence of larger and more contigu- ous areas of closed-canopy forest, likely increasing the amount of Spotted Owl habitat compared to conditions prior to European settlement. Concomitant with these changes has been a decline in the amount and quality of open ponderosa pine habitat and an increased risk of stand-replacement fi re and large-scale insect outbreaks. Consequently, present conditions are not sustainable in the long- term and ecological management objectives are confl icted. Continued fi re suppression will further degrade ponderosa pine forest and increase the likelihood that landscape-level fi res will eliminate habitat used by both Spotted Owls (associated with closed-canopy forest) and a number of pine- dependent (open-canopy) species. Landscape-level models that address fi re risk and forest health in a dry forest landscape should be developed and used to identify best possible confi gurations of forest patches necessary to reduce fi re risk while addressing the divergent habitat needs of Spotted Owls and a suite of species associated with ponderosa pine forests. This strategy can be applied in other dry forest landscapes to address similarly confl icting management objectives. Fire suppression and related issues were recently identifi ed by Partners in Flight as having great importance to bird conservation in forests of the Intermountain West. Partners in Flight can play a crucial role in research and monitoring efforts and in the development and dissemination of information.},

abstract = {Spatial depictions of fire regimes are indispensable to fire management
because they portray important characteristics of wildland fire, such as
severity, intensity, and pattern, across a landscape that serves as
important reference for future treatment activities. However, spatially
explicit fire regime maps are difficult and costly to create requiring
extensive expertise in fire history sampling, multivariate statistics,
remotely sensed image classification, fire behaviour and effects, fuel
dynamics, landscape ecology, simulation modelling, and geographical
information systems (GIS). This paper first compares three common
strategies for predicting fire regimes ( classification, empirical, and
simulation) using a 51 000 ha landscape in the
Selway-BitterrootWilderness Area of Montana, USA. Simulation modelling
is identified as the best overall strategy with respect to developing
temporally deep spatial fire patterns, but it has limitations. To
illustrate these problems, we performed three simulation experiments
using the LANDSUM spatial model to determine the relative importance of
( 1) simulation time span; ( 2) fire frequency parameters; and ( 3) fire
size parameters on the simulation of landscape fire return interval. The
model used to simulate fire regimes is also very important, so we
compared two spatially explicit landscape fire succession models (
LANDSUM and FIRESCAPE) to demonstrate differences between model
predictions and limitations of each on a neutral landscape. FIRESCAPE
was developed for simulating fire regimes in eucalypt forests of
south-eastern Australia. Finally, challenges for future simulation and
fire regime research are presented including field data, scale, fire
regime variability, map obsolescence, and classification resolution.},

abstract = {Crown fires associated with extreme fire severity are extremely difficult to control. We have assessed fire severity using differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) from Landsat imagery in 15 historical wildfires of Pinus halepensis Mill. We have considered a wide range of innovative topographic, fuel and fire behavior variables with the purposes of (1) determining the variables that influence fire severity patterns among fires (considering the 15 wildfires together) and (2) ascertaining whether different variables affect extreme fire severity within the three fire types (topographic, convective and wind-driven fires). The among-fires analysis showed that fires in less arid climates and with steeper slopes had more extreme severity. In less arid conditions there was more crown fuel accumulation and closer forest structures, promoting high vertical and horizontal fuel continuity and extreme fire severity. The analyses carried out for each fire separately (within fires) showed more extreme fire severity in areas in northern aspects, with steeper slopes, with high crown biomass and in climates with more water availability. In northern aspects solar radiation was lower and fuels had less water limitation to growth which, combined with steeper slopes, produced more extreme severity. In topographic fires there was more extreme severity in northern aspects with steeper slopes and in areas with more water availability and high crown biomass; in convection-dominated fires there was also more extreme fire severity in northern aspects with high biomass; while in wind-driven fires there was only a slight interaction between biomass and water availability. This latter pattern could be related to the fact that wind-driven fires spread with high wind speed, which could have minimized the effect of other variables. In the future, and as a consequence of climate change, new zones with high crown biomass accumulated in non-common drought areas will be available to burn as extreme severity wildfires.},

abstract = {Long-term forest landscape dynamics are determined by a set of driving forces including large-scale natural disturbances, land-use, the physical environment, and stand-scale succession processes. Landscape models have an important role as tools for synthesizing existing information and making projections of possible future vegetation dynamics on large spatial scales. However, current landscape models cannot readily be used to study: (1) the change from weakly to strongly disturbed landscapes; (2) the impact of changing climatic parameters on landscape-scale dynamics; and (3) the effects of such changes on vegetation structure. Using European mountain forests as a case study, this paper focuses on improving the well-established LANDIS landscape model so that it can be applied to study these research questions. We integrated a simple tree succession sub-model in LANDIS, which incorporates quantitative descriptions of forest structure, and included sub-models to capture the influences of competition as well as climatic and edaphic parameters on tree population dynamics. The new model was subjected to a number of quantitative tests against measured data. It accurately predicted the altitudinal distribution of vegetation properties under managed as well as unmanaged conditions in the Dischma valley (Switzerland), and it provided realistic and accurate patterns of vegetation recovery following wind disturbance events, in spite of the very simple model formulations. To demonstrate the utility of the added detail, we applied the model in scenario mode under a range of changes in climatic and disturbance parameters, assuming a continuation of the current management regime. The simulations showed that the various driving forces have quite different effects on different species, and that their combined effect differs from one scenario to the next. Notably, there are few models that integrate forest growth and succession with disturbance dynamics in a semimechanistic manner. Our version of LANDIS achieves this integration based on simple concepts and methods that do not require many parameter estimates. We conclude that the new model has the potential to provide an integrated picture of the impacts of both direct and indirect effects of climate change on forest landscape dynamics},

abstract = {A spatially explicit forest gap model was developed for the Sierra Nevada, California, and is the first of its kind because it integrates climate, fire and forest pattern. The model simulates a forest stand as a grid of 1515 m forest plots and simulates the growth of individual trees within each plot. Fuel inputs are generated from each individual tree according to tree size and species. Fuel moisture varies both temporally and spatially with the local site water balance and forest condition, thus linking climate with the fire regime. Fires occur as a function of the simulated fuel loads and fuel moisture, and the burnable area is simulated as a result of the spatially heterogeneous fuel bed conditions. We demonstrate the model's ability to couple the fire regime to both climate and forest pattern. In addition, we use the model to investigate the importance of climate and forest pattern as controls on the fire regime. Comparison of model results with independent data indicate that the model performs well in several areas. Patterns of fuel accumulation, climatic control of fire frequency and the influence of fuel loads on the spatial extent of fires in the model are particularly well-supported by data. This model can be used to examine the complex interactions among climate, fire and forest pattern across a wide range of environmental conditions and vegetation types. Our results suggest that, in the Sierra Nevada, fuel moisture can exert an important control on fire frequency and this control is especially pronounced at sites where most of the annual precipitation is in the form of snow. Fuel loads, on the other hand, may limit the spatial extent of fire, especially at elevations below 1500 m. Above this elevation, fuel moisture may play an increasingly important role in limiting the area burned.},

abstract = {To address hazardous fuel accumulations, many fuel treatments are being implemented in dry forests, but there have been few opportunities to evaluate treatment efficacy in wildfires. We documented the effectiveness of thinning and prescribed burning in the 2006 Tripod Complex fires. Recent fuel treatments burned in the wildfires and offered an opportunity to evaluate if two treatments (thin only and thin and prescribed burn) mitigated fire severity. Fire severity was markedly different between the two treatments. Over 57% of trees survived in thin and prescribed burn (thinRx) units versus 19% in thin only (thin) and 14% in control units. Considering only large-diameter trees (>20 cm diameter at breast height), 73% survived in thinRx units versus 36% and 29% in thin and control units, respectively. Logistic regression modeling demonstrates significant reductions in the log-odds probability of tree death under both treatments with a much greater reduction in thinRx units. Other severity measures, including percent crown scorch and burn severity index, are significantly lower in thinRx units than in thin and control units. This study provides strong quantitative evidence that thinning alone does not reduce wildfire severity but that thinning followed by prescribed burning is effective at mitigating wildfire severity in dry western forests.},

It provides the basis for a methodology to include spatial interactions between plants of different size, function and growth-form in models of plant community dynamics. The key components of EFT are: 1. the influence domain of individuals (D), 2. the field intensity within the domains (I), 3. the influence surface (ID) and 4. the intensity of interactions (II). The means to calculate these key components are outlined and several tests of the methodology as applied to a semi-arid eucalypt woodland are presented. The tests include a comparison of measured shrub growth with a cqmputer implementation of EFT (the RESCOMP model) and spatial growth data from the eucalypt woodland to support the postulates included in EFT. Practical uses expected for the method are in agroforestry, landscape rehabilitation, simulations of disturbance effects and in determining invasibility of plant communities. \},

abstract = {Wildfire affects the ecosystem services of watersheds, and climate change will modify fire regimes and watershed dynamics. In many eco-hydrological simulations, fire is included as an exogenous force. Rarely are the bidirectional feedbacks between watersheds and fire regimes integrated in a simulation system because the eco- hydrological model predicts variables that are incompatible with the requirements of fire models. WMFire is a fire- spread model of intermediate complexity designed to be integrated with the Regional Hydro-ecological Simulation System (RHESSys). Spread in WMFire is based on four variables that (i) represent known influences on fire spread: litter load, relative moisture deficit, wind direction and topographic slope, and (ii) are derived directly from RHESSys outputs. The probability that a fire spreads from pixel to pixel depends on these variables as predicted by RHESSys. We tested a partial integration between WMFire and RHESSys on the Santa Fe (New Mexico) and the HJ Andrews (Oregon State) watersheds. Model assessment showed correspondence between expected spatial patterns of spread and seasonality in both watersheds. These results demonstrate the efficacy of an approach to link eco-hydrologic model outputs with a fire spread model. Future work will develop a fire effects module in RHESSys for a fully coupled, bidirectional model},

We have examined the dynamic behaviour of the flame front and the final state (after extinction) on randomly created heterogeneous zones, both with and without wind. The principal conclusion is that critical thresholds exist, for the ratio between combustible and noncombustible parts, at the transition between nonpropagation and propagation of the fire. This result is common to all types of spreading (with or without wind). The values of the critical thresholds in the nonwind-driven experiments are those of the percolation theory. The critical exponent, obtained for wind-driven experiments, is in accordance with current values suggested by the directed percolation approach.},

Six traditional and commonly used models for the description of this relationship included the Poisson, exponential, metapopulation, fractal, negative binomial, and improved negative binomial models. However, these models deviate systematically form empirical data. We present a model (the "droopy-tail" model or DTM) that improves estimates of occupancy at coarse scales by taking the percolation effect of scale on the occupancy abundance relationship into account. The DTM is a fundamental departure from previous models because the slope of the scaling curve limits to negative infinity (rather than zero) at coarse scales in addition to providing a good fit to empirical data at all spatial scales.},

abstract = {Issues of residual spatial autocorrelation (RSA) and spatial scale are critical to the study of species-environment relationships, because RSA invalidates many statistical procedures, while the scale of analysis affects the quantification of these relationships. Although these issues independently are widely covered in the literature, only sparse attention is given to their integration. This paper focuses on the interplay between RSA and the spatial scaling of species-environment relationships. Using a hypothetical species in an artificial landscape, we show that a mismatch between the scale of analysis and the scale of a species' response to its environment leads to a decrease in the portion of variation explained by environmental predictors. Moreover, it results in RSA and biased regression coefficients. This bias stems from error-predictor dependencies due to the scale mismatch, the magnitude of which depends on the interaction between the scale of landscape heterogeneity and the scale of a species' response to this heterogeneity. We show that explicitly considering scale effects on RSA can reveal the characteristic scale of a species' response to its environment. This is important, because the estimation of species-environment relationships using spatial regression methods proves to be erroneous in case of a scale mismatch, leading to spurious conclusions when scaling issues are not explicitly considered. The findings presented here highlight the importance of examining the appropriateness of the spatial scales used in analyses, since scale mismatches affect the rigor of statistical analyses and thereby the ability to understand the processes underlying spatial patterning in ecological phenomena.},

This is to take account of the multi-gear nature of the fishery and the spatial structure of the trends in catch rate. The data on whether or not the catch rate is zero and the catch rate given that it is non-zero are analysed separately and then combined to provide indices of abundance. The former analysis is based on assuming the data are Bernoulli random variables.

abstract = {We present a comprehensive analysis of factors affecting resource allocation and crown formation in a subarctic birch tree, Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii (Orlova) H{\"{a}}met- Ahti. Using biomass measurements and digitized data on tree architecture, we investigated several hypotheses on various factors that may modify plant growth. We also analyzed the extent to which different mechanisms operate at different scales, ranging from individual shoots to the whole branches or trees. Different factors affected allocation at different levels of organization. Stem age had a minor effect, suggesting that similar control mechanisms operate at all stages of development. Fates of individual shoots were affected by their local growing conditions as indicated, for example, by the dependence of long shoot production on light. Buds formed in the current long shoots were likely to become new long shoots. In the innermost crown parts, radial growth had priority compared to long shoot production. Elongation of individual long shoots was controlled by two conflicting factors. Long distance from the roots suppressed growth, probably indicating costs associated with resource transportation, whereas a high level of light augmented growth. In contrast, growth of entire branches was not so clearly related to the availability of resources, but showed limitation due to allometric scaling. This set a relationship between the maximum long shoot number and the overall branch size, and may indicate allometric constraints to the way a tree is constructed. Strict allometric relationships existed also between other structural traits of mountain birch, most of them similar at all levels of branching hierarchy. However, despite the upper level restrictions set by allometry, source-sink interactions and localized responses of individual shoots operated as local processes that directed allocation towards the most favourable positions. This may be a mechanism for achieving efficient tree architecture in terms of resource intake and costs of transportation.},

abstract = {Most methods for modeling species distributions from occurrence records require additional data representing the range of environmental conditions in the modeled region. These data, called background or pseudo-absence data, are usually drawn at random from the entire region, whereas occurrence collection is often spatially biased toward easily accessed areas. Since the spatial bias generally results in environmental bias, the difference between occurrence collection and background sampling may lead to inaccurate models. To correct the estimation, we propose choosing background data with the same bias as occurrence data. We investigate theoretical and practical implications of this approach. Accurate information about spatial bias is usually lacking, so explicit biased sampling of background sites may not be possible. However, it is likely that an entire target group of species observed by similar methods will share similar bias. We therefore explore the use of all occurrences within a target group as biased background data. We compare model performance using target-group background and randomly sampled background on a comprehensive collection of data for 226 species from diverse regions of the world. We find that target-group background improves average performance for all the modeling methods we consider, with the choice of background data having as large an effect on predictive performance as the choice of modeling method. The performance improvement due to target-group background is greatest when there is strong bias in the target-group presence records. Our approach applies to regression-based modeling methods that have been adapted for use with occurrence data, such as generalized linear or additive models and boosted regression trees, and to Maxent, a probability density estimation method. We argue that increased awareness of the implications of spatial bias in surveys, and possible modeling remedies, will substantially improve predictions of species distributions.},

abstract = {Finding novel ways to plan and implement landscape-level forest treatments that protect sensitive wildlife and other key ecosystem components, while also reducing the risk of large-scale, high-severity fires, can prove to be difficult. We examined alternative approaches to landscape-scale fuel-treatment design for the same landscape. These approaches included two different treatment scenarios generated from an optimization algorithm that reduces modeled fire spread across the landscape, one with resource-protection constrains and one without the same. We also included a treatment scenario that was the actual fuel-treatment network implemented, as well as a no-treatment scenario. For all the four scenarios, we modeled hazardous fire potential based on conditional burn probabilities, and projected fire emissions. Results demonstrate that in all the three active treatment scenarios, hazardous fire potential, fire area, and emissions were reduced by approximately 50 % relative to the untreated condition. Results depict that incorporation of constraints is more effective at reducing modeled fire outputs, possibly due to the greater aggregation of treatments, creating greater continuity of fuel-treatment blocks across the landscape. The implementation of fuel-treatment networks using different planning techniques that incorporate real-world constraints can reduce the risk of large problematic fires, allow for landscape-level heterogeneity that can provide necessary ecosystem services, create mixed forest stand structures on a landscape, and promote resilience in the uncertain future of climate change.},

The Boreal Fire Effects Model calculates fuel consumption for different live biomass and dead organic matter pools in each burned cell according to fuel type, fuel load, burning conditions, and resulting fire behaviour. Carbon emissions are calculated from fuel consumption. CWFIS summarises the data in the form of disturbance matrices and provides spatially explicit estimates of area burned for national reporting. CBM-CFS3 integrates, at the national scale, these fire data with data on forest management and other disturbances. The methodology for estimating fire emissions was tested using a large-fire pilot study.A framework to implement the procedures at the national scale is described.},

abstract = {Active crown fires affect forest ecosystem structure and function, and the livelihood of the surrounding human communities. Researchers and managers use simulation models to understand fire behavior and predict fire hazard. Accurate predictions depend on the capacity of simulation models to represent the processes that control fire behavior and on the quality of the data used. The data required to predict crown fire hazard include surface and canopy fuel characteristics. Because these variables are difficult to measure, fire behavior specialists categorize surface fuels into standard Surface Fuel Models, and calculate canopy fuel variables based on assumptions (e.g., canopy base height (CBH), canopy bulk density (CBD)). Our objectives were: (1) to analyze the sensitivity of CBH and CBD to assumptions made in their calculations, and (2) to determine the consequences for crown fire hazard due to variability in CBH, CBD and among Fuel Models. We calculated a range of values of CBH and CBD for 14 ponderosa pine stands in the Colorado Front Range, USA, by varying the assumptions made in their calculations. We found that CBH and CBD were sensitive to crown shape. If shapes were observed in the field, these metrics would better represent canopy structure. We used NEXUS, a spreadsheet model, to predict crown fire hazard at the 14 sites, using the above-mentioned range of CBH and CBD values, and four different Surface Fuel Models commonly used in montane forests. NEXUS predicted that more extreme weather was generally needed for wildfires to reach the crowns of trees than for the fires to actively spread once they had crowned. The selected fuel model was the main variable affecting crown fire hazard. Seven sites burned in 2002, after our field data were collected. Correspondence between burn severity and NEXUS predictions of fire behavior was generally high. Where this correspondence was weak, the differences could be assigned to variation in weather conditions or the presence of hard to quantify ladder fuels. Our results demonstrate that researchers and managers need to estimate inputs fire behavior models carefully to enhance their predictive capacity. They also suggest that prescribed fires are likely effective fuel reduction treatments. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Although it is generally accepted that the rate of accumulation of biomass declines as forests age, little is known about the relative contributions to this decline of changes in net primary production (NPP) and tree mortality. We used 10-15 years of observations of permanent plots in three small watersheds in and near the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon, to examine these issues. The three watersheds are of similar elevation and potential productivity and support young (29 years at last measurement), mature (approximately 100 years) and old (approximately 400 years) forest dominated by Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco and Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg. Accumulation of tree bole biomass was greatest in the young stand, reaching approximately 7 Mg ha-1 year-1 in the last measurement interval. Bole biomass accumulation was relatively constant (approximately 4-5 Mg ha-1 year-1) in the mature stand, and there was no net accumulation of bole biomass in the old-forest stand. The NPP of boles increased with time in the young stand, from approximately 3 to approximately 7 Mg ha-1 year-1, but was nearly constant in the mature and old-forest stands, at approximately 6 and 3-4 Mg ha-1 year-1, respectively. Mortality increased slowly in the young stand (from < 0.1 to 0.3 Mg ha-1 year-1), but fluctuated between 1-2 and 2-6 Mg ha-1 year-1 in the mature and old-forest stands, respectively. Thus, declining biomass accumulation with stand age reflects, in approximately equal amounts, both decreasing NPP and increasing mortality.},

abstract = {Abstract—We combine simulation and optimization techniques to test hypotheses about variable-intensity management in a 15,000- acre forest reserve. The Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) and integer optimization techniques together help identify tradeoffs between two landscape resource goals: maintaining late successional forest and reducing the threat of wildfire. The FVS model allows us to evaluate the contribution of stand-level treatments to each landscape goal, whereas optimization identifies efficient solutions that allow us to test for complementary or competitive relations between the two goals over time and space. The methods we discuss in this paper are adaptable to forested areas of various sizes and with different resource goals. To illustrate the value and innovation of our approach, an example demonstrates how uncertainty in FVS simulations might affect landscape solutions. This example is the pilot application of a new FVS bootstrap model. Our preliminary results indicate that we should change the definition of late-successional forest used for our final analysis.},

Efficiency of the proposed estimators in two simple situations is considered. The approach is closely related to quasi-likelihood.},

abstract = {For two decades, the US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, has been charged with implementing a nationwide field-based forest health monitoring effort. Given its extensive nature, the monitoring program has been gradually implemented across forest health indicators and inventoried states. Currently, the Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis program has initiated forest health inventories in all states, and most forest health indicators are being documented in terms of sampling protocols, data management structures, and estimation procedures. Field data from most sample years and indicators are available on-line with numerous analytical examples published both internally and externally. This investment in national forest health monitoring has begun to yield dividends by allowing evaluation of state/regional forest health issues (e.g., pollution and invasive pests) and contributing substantially to national/international reporting efforts (e.g., National Report on Sustainability and US EPA Annual Greenhouse Gas Estimates). With the emerging threat of climate change, full national implementation and remeasurement of a forest health inventory should allow for more robust assessment of forest communities that are undergoing unprecedented changes, aiding future land management and policy decisions.},

abstract = {An improved understanding of the mechanisms that regulate wildfire risk at local to regional scales is needed for the design of effective fire and ecosystem management. We investigated the spatial distribution of burned area in Southern California during 1960–2009 using five different data-driven methods: multiple linear regression, generalized additive models (GAMs), GAMs with spatial autocorrelation, non-linear multiplicative models, and random forest models. We used each method to separately develop burned area risk maps for Southern California's two distinct wildfire regimes: Santa Ana (SA fires), which occur during high wind events mostly in autumn, and non-Santa Ana fires (non-SA fires), which occur mostly during the hot and dry Mediterranean-climate summer. The different methods explained 38–63% of the spatial variance in burned area for SA fires and 21–48% for non-SA fires. The two fire regimes had contrasting drivers, with Fosberg fire weather index, relative humidity, minimum temperature, and distance to housing most important for SA fires, and shrub cover, road density, and distance to minor and major roads most important for non-SA fires. Our modeling framework carries implications for the strategic placement of fire suppression resources, and for prevention planning in areas facing increasing human and climate pressures.},

abstract = {Forest management faces an uncertain future with changing climates and disturbance regimes. Multi-aged forest management systems represent a promising approach for increasing resistance and resilience, thereby limiting major disruptions to timber production and other ecosystem services. Multi-aged stands inherently have greater resistance and resilience to disturbances because of the presence of several age classes and more potential pathways for post-disturbance management and recovery. The preponderance of research also indicates few differences in productivity between multi-aged and even-aged management strategies. These factors combined suggest that increased adoption of multi-aged management systems will lead to a reduction in long-term risks. We advocate a disturbance integration management strategy that encourages managers to emulate disturbance effects with management, anticipate disturbances in planning, integrate the management of residual stand structures into salvage operations and build variable treatment intervals or cutting cycles into management regimes.},

abstract = {Sagebrush landscapes provide habitat for Sage-Grouse and other sagebrush obligates, yet historical fire regimes and the structure of historical sagebrush landscapes are poorly known, hampering ecological restoration and management. To remedy this, General Land Office Survey (GLO) survey notes were used to reconstruct over two million hectares of historical vegetation for four sagebrush-dominated (Artemisia spp.) study areas in the western United States. Reconstructed vegetation was analyzed for fire indicators used to identify historical fires and reconstruct historical fire regimes. Historical fire-size distributions were inverse-J shaped, and one fire >100 000 ha was identified. Historical fire rotations were estimated at 171-342 years for Wyoming big sagebrush (A. tridentata ssp. wyomingensis) and 137-217 years for mountain big sagebrush (A. tridentata ssp. vaseyana). Historical fire and patch sizes were significantly larger in Wyoming big sagebrush than mountain big sagebrush, and historical fire rotations were significantly longer in Wyoming big sagebrush than mountain big sagebrush. Historical fire rotations in Wyoming were longer than those in other study areas. Fine-scale mosaics of burned and unburned area and larger unburned inclusions within fire perimeters were less common than in modern fires. Historical sagebrush landscapes were dominated by large, contiguous areas of sagebrush, though large grass-dominated areas and finer-scale mosaics of grass and sagebrush were also present in smaller amounts. Variation in sagebrush density was a common source of patchiness, and areas classified as "dense'' made up 24.5% of total sagebrush area, compared to 16.3% for "scattered'' sagebrush. Results suggest significant differences in historical and modern fire regimes. Modern fire rotations in Wyoming big sagebrush are shorter than historical fire rotations. Results also suggest that historical sagebrush landscapes would have fluctuated, because of infrequent episodes of large fires and long periods of recovery and maturity. Due to fragmentation of sagebrush landscapes, the large, contiguous expanses of sagebrush that dominated historically are most at risk and in need of conservation, including both dense and scattered sagebrush. Fire suppression in Wyoming big sagebrush may also be advisable, as modern fire rotations are shorter than their historical counterparts.},

abstract = {Fire is well recognized as a key Earth system process, but its causes and influences vary greatly across spatial and temporal scales. The controls of fire are often portrayed as a set of superimposed triangles, with processes ranging from oxygen to weather to climate, combustion to fuel to vegetation, and local to landscape to regional drivers over broadening spatial and lengthening temporal scale. Most ecological studies and fire management plans consider the effects of fire-weather and fuels on local to sub-regional scales and time frames of years to decades. Fire reconstructions developed from high-resolution tree-ring records and lake-sediment data that span centuries to millennia offer unique insights about fire's role that cannot otherwise be obtained. Such records help disclose the historical range of variability in fire activity over the duration of a vegetation type; the role of large-scale changes of climate, such as seasonal changes in summer insolation; the consequences of major reorganizations in vegetation; and the influence of prehistoric human activity in different ecological settings. This paleoecological perspective suggests that fire-regime definitions, which focus on the characteristic frequency, size and intensity of fire and particular fuel types, should be reconceptualized to better include the controls of fire regimes over the duration of a particular biome. We suggest that approaches currently used to analyze fire regimes across multiple spatial scales should be employed to examine fire occurrence across multiple temporal scales. Such cross-scale patterns would better reveal the full variability of particular fire regimes and their controls, and provide relevant information for the types of fire regimes likely to occur in the future with projected climate and land-use change.},

abstract = {The use of distributed data for model calibration is becoming more popular in the advent of the availability of spatially distributed observations. Hydrological model calibration has traditionally been carried out using single objective optimisation and only recently has been extended to a multi-objective optimisation domain. By formulating the calibration problem with several objectives, each objective relating to a set of observations, the parameter sets can be constrained more effectively. However, many previous multi-objective calibration studies do not consider individual observations or catchment responses separately, but instead utilises some form of aggregation of objectives. This paper proposes a multi-objective calibration approach that can efficiently handle many objectives using both clustering and preference ordered ranking. The algorithm is applied to calibrate the MIKE SHE distributed hydrologic model and tested on the Karup catchment in Denmark. The results indicate that the preferred solutions selected using the proposed algorithm are good compromise solutions and the parameter values are well defined. Clustering with Kohonen mapping was able to reduce the number of objective functions from 18 to 5. Calibration using the standard deviation of groundwater level residuals enabled us to identify a group of wells that may not be simulated properly, thus highlighting potential problems with the model parameterisation. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A Geographic Information System was used to locate HCWs that occurred on VI from 1950 through 1992, to divide VI into 1 km??1 km grid cells, and to determine for each grid cell the climate and distances to various human-built infrastructures. Logistic regression was used to build a predictive model of the probability of HCW occurrence in each of the grid cells, using climate and distances as predictor variables. A total of 6329 wildfires occurred on VI over the 43 years study period, and 2747 of the grid cells contained at least one fire. The probability of a grid cell burning was positively correlated with summer temperature, and negatively correlated with precipitation and distances to municipalities, campgrounds, dirt roads, railroads and paved roads. Grid cells were grouped into five classes of HCW probability: <20, 20-39, 40-59, 60-79, >80%. The lower the probability of HCW occurrence, the lower the number of fires per km 2 per year, the longer the fire cycle in years, and the larger the mean fire size. The unexpected larger mean fire size in areas with low HCW probability is due to logging fires being the most common type there, and logging fires being significantly larger than other types on all portions of VI. Where the HCW probability was highest, recreation and miscellaneous fires were most common, and these types of fires tended to be significantly smaller. The annual number and annual area burned by HCWs on VI has been decreasing. These decreases have occurred primarily in the areas that have a high HCW probability, while increases have occurred where the HCW probability is low. These results indicate that HCWs are a significant part of the temperate rainforest ecosystem and that the spatial variation in their occurrence could be used to delimit fire management zones. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of forest thinning and burning treatments on restoring fire behavior attributes in western USA pine forests. Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), with co-occurring species, are adapted to a disturbance regime of frequent surface fires, but extended fire exclusion and other factors have led to historically uncharacteristically dense stands and high fuel loadings, supporting high-severity fires. Treatments to begin to reverse these changes and reduce fuel hazards have been tested experimentally and obser- vations of wildfire behavior in treated stands have also been reported. Using a systematic review methodology, we found 54 studies with quantitative data suitable for meta-analysis. Combined treat- ments (thinning + burning) tended to have the greatest effect on reducing surface fuels and stand den- sity, and raising modeled crowning and torching indices, as compared to burning or thinning alone. However, changes in canopy base height and canopy bulk density were not consistently related to treatment intensity, as measured by basal area reduction. There are a number of qualifications to the findings. First, because it is not feasible to subject treated areas to severe fire experimentally, inferences about potential fire behavior rely on imperfect modeling techniques. Second, research has not been carried uniformly over the ranges of the pine forests, although we found no significant differences in treatment effects between regions or forest types. Overall, however, meta-analysis of the literature to date strongly indicates that thinning and/or burning treatments do have effects con- sistent with the restoration of low-severity fire behavior. },

abstract = {Anthropogenic alteration of ecosystem processes confounds forest management and conservation of rare, declining species. Restoration of forest structure and fire hazard reduction are central goals of forest management policy in the western United States, but restoration priorities and treatments have become increasingly contentious. Numerous studies have documented changes in fire regimes, forest stand structure and species composition following a century of fire exclusion in dry, frequent-fire forests of the western U.S. (e.g., ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer). In contrast, wet mixed-conifer forests are thought to have historically burned infrequently with mixed- or high-severity fire—resulting in reduced impacts from fire exclusion and low restoration need—but data are limited. In this study we quantified the current forest habitat of the federally endangered, terrestrial Jemez Mountains salamander (Plethodon neomexicanus) and compared it to dendroecological reconstructions of historical habitat (e.g., stand structure and composition), and fire regime parameters along a gradient from upper ponderosa pine to wet mixed-conifer forests. We found that current fire-free intervals in Jemez Mountains salamander habitat (116–165 years) are significantly longer than historical intervals, even in wet mixed-conifer forests. Historical mean fire intervals ranged from 10 to 42 years along the forest gradient. Low-severity fires were historically dominant across all forest types (92 of 102 fires). Although some mixed- or highseverity fire historically occurred at 67% of the plots over the last four centuries, complete mortality within 1.0 ha plots was rare, and asynchronous within and among sites. Climate was an important driver of temporal variability in fire severity, such that mixed- and high-severity fires were associated with more extreme drought than low-severity fires. Tree density in dry conifer forests historically ranged from open (90 trees ha1) to moderately dense (400 trees ha1), but has doubled on average since fire exclusion. Infill of fire-sensitive tree species has contributed to the conversion of historically dry mixedconifer to wet mixed-conifer forest. We conclude that low-severity fire, which has been absent for over a century, was a critical ecosystem process across the forest gradient in Jemez Mountains salamander habitat, and thus is an important element of ecosystem restoration, resilience, and rare species recovery},

Typically, such models are highly integrated, they produce multiple outputs, and standard methods of model analysis are ill suited for evaluating them. We show how multicriteria optimization with Pareto optimality allows for model outputs to be compared to multiple system components simultaneously and improves three areas in which models are used for biological problems. In the study of optimal biological structures, Pareto optimality allows for the identification of multiple solutions possible for organism survival and reproduction, which thereby explains variability in optimal behavior. For model assessment, multicriteria optimization helps to illuminate and describe model deficiencies and uncertainties in model structure.

abstract = {Restoring characteristic fire regimes and forest structures are central objectives of many restoration and fuel reduction projects. Within-stand spatial pattern is a fundamental attribute of forest structure and influences many ecological processes and ecosystem functions. In this review we synthesize the available spatial reference information for fire-frequent pine and mixed-conifer forests in western North America; interpret this information in the context of restoration and fuel reduction treatment design; and identify areas for future research, including recommended approaches for quantifying within-stand tree spatial patterns. We identified 50 studies of tree spatial patterns in fire-frequent pine and mixed conifer forests, 25 of which documented spatial reference conditions. The characteristic structure of fire-frequent forests is a mosaic of three elements: openings, single trees, and clumps of trees with adjacent or interlocking crowns. This mosaic structure typically manifests at scales <0.4 ha, but sometimes extends to scales as large as 4 ha, particularly on sites with fire regimes that include both low- and moderate-severity fires. We documented preferential use of global pattern analysis techniques (90% of analyses) relative to local analysis techniques (10% of analyses). Ripley's K statistic, an example of global spatial pattern analysis, was the most frequently used analytic technique (38% of analyses). These findings are important because global pattern analysis does not explicitly quantify spatial heterogeneity within a pattern, the very thing spatial reference studies seek to characterize and one of the core structural attributes treatments aim to restore. Based on these findings, we encourage managers to consciously adopt a view of forest structure that accommodates spatial heterogeneity within forest stands, and to use this conceptualization of forest structure to guide prescription development. Restoration prescriptions and marking guidelines that explicitly incorporate within-stand spatial heterogeneity—such as by specifying the numbers and sizes of openings and tree clumps, and the number of widely-spaced single trees to retain per unit area—will improve the likelihood of restoring characteristic forest structures and the ecological processes such structures support. We infer that the near-exclusive use of global pattern analysis has limited the quantity and usability of spatial reference information available to managers, has also likely limited the development and testing of novel ecological hypotheses about pattern-generating mechanisms. Consequently, we recommend that forest scientists change how they quantify tree spatial patterns by complimenting the traditional global analysis methods with local pattern analysis techniques, which quantify spatial heterogeneity within a study area.},

worldwide. Understanding the complex feedbacks among vegetation as a
fuel for fire, the effects of fuels on fire behavior, and the impact of
fire behavior on future vegetation are critical for sustaining
biodiversity, in fire-dependent forests. Nonetheless, understanding in
fire ecology has been limited in part by the difficulties in
establishing the connections between fire behavior and vegetation
response. To address this issue, we present the concept of the ecology
of fuels, which emphasizes the critical role that fuels play in
conceptually linking feedbacks between fire and vegetation. This
article explores the ecology of the fuels concept for longleaf pine
woodlands and illustrates its utility by evaluating the principles of
ecological forestry (incorporating legacies of disturbances,
understanding intermediate stand development processes, and allowing
for recovery periods) in this chronically disturbed ecosystem. We
review the research behind our understanding of these feedbacks in
longleaf pine ecosystems of the southeastern United States and review
the applications of these principles through the Stoddard-Neel method
of ecological forestry. Understanding these feedbacks is critical for
integrating fire ecology and ecological forestry in the Southeast and
in other fire-dependent forest types.},

abstract = {Aims To assess the impact of various fire regimes over the past 30 years on land snail communities and to analyse the role of recent landscape history and the influence of biogeography in shaping the response patterns of gastropod communities following disturbances by fire. Location South-eastern France (Provence) and Mediterranean region. Methods Stratified sampling within 12 sites was undertaken with regard to fire regime (i.e. number of fires, fire intervals and age of the last fire) occurring over the past 30 years. The study was complemented by a historical analysis using aerial photographs, old maps of vegetation cover and an analysis of the biogeographical composition of malacofaunas. Data were investigated using Correspondence Analysis and S{\o}rensen coefficient of similarity. Results When a disturbance regime (land use or fire disturbances) has been maintained over decades or centuries, land snail communities appear highly modified and tend to be composed of only Mediterranean and xerophilous species. However, low fire regimes, since the 1970s, do not seem to greatly affect the composition of gastropod communities. Indeed, shade-loving, mesophilous and European range species persist even after successive fires within some sites. In addition, the malacofaunas have a higher component of European range species with increasing distance from the Mediterranean sea. Main conclusions Analysis of the response patterns of gastropod communities to fire shows a response to numerous different factors. The composition of current land snail communities is not only the result of (more or less) recent patterns of fire regimes but also of anthropogenic disturbances, of landscape changes over the last centuries and of subsequent structure of the pre-fire habitat, as well as of the influence of a biogeographical gradient. However, the response patterns observed and the persistence of pre-fire communities imply the presence of cryptic refuges located within burned areas.},

abstract = {Several recent studies in landscape ecology have found periodicity in correlograms or semi-variograms calculated, for instance, from spatial data of soils, forests, or animal populations. Some of the studies interpreted this as an indication of regular or periodic landscape patterns. This interpretation is in disagreement with other studies that doubt whether such analysis is valid. The objective of our study was to explore the relationship between periodicity in landscape patterns and geostatistical models. We were especially interested in the validity of the assumption that periodicity in geostatistical models indicates periodicity in landscape pattern, and whether the former can characterize frequency and magnitude of the latter. We created maps containing various periodic spatial patterns, derived correlograms from these, and examined periodicity in the correlograms. We also created non-regular maps that we suspected would cause periodicity in correlograms. Our results demonstrate that a) various periodic spatial patterns produce periodicity in correlograms derived from them, b) the distance-lags at which correlograms peak correspond to the average distances between patch centers, c) periodicity is strongest when the diameter of patches is equal to the distance between patch edges, d) periodicity in omni-directional correlograms of complex spatial patterns (such as checkerboards) are combinations of several waves because inter-patch distances differ with direction; multiple directional correlograms can decompose such complexity, and e) periodicity in correlograms can also be caused when the number of patches in a study site is small. These results highlight that correlograms can be used to detect and describe regular spatial patterns. However, it is crucial to ensure that the assumption of stationarity is not violated, i.e., that the study area contains a sufficiently large number of patches to avoid incorrect conclusions.},

abstract = {Abstract. Spatial point pattern analysis provides a statistical method to compare an observed spatial pattern against a hypothesized spatial process model. The G statistic, which considers the distribution of nearest neighbor distances, and the K statistic, which evaluates the distribution of all neighbor distances, are commonly used in such analyses. One method of employing these statistics involves building a simulation envelope from the result of many simulated patterns of the hypothesized model. Specifically, a simulation envelope is created by calculating, at every distance, the minimum and maximum results computed across the simulated patterns. A statistical test is performed by evaluating where the results from an observed pattern fall with respect to the simulation envelope. However, this method, which differs from P. Diggle's suggested approach, is invalid for inference because it violates the assumptions of Monte Carlo methods and results in incorrect type I error rate performance. Similarly, using the simulation envelope to estimate the range of distances over which an observed pattern deviates from the hypothesized model is also suspect. The technical details of why the simulation envelope provides incorrect type I error rate performance are described. A valid test is then proposed, and details about how the number of simulated patterns impacts the statistical significance are explained. Finally, an example of using the proposed test within an exploratory data analysis framework is provided. Key words: G, K, and L statistic; Monte Carlo; simulation envelope; spatial point},

tree models used in ecology and climate change research. However, most
gap model emphasize, in terms of process detail, computer code, and
validation effort, tree growth with little attention to the simulation

limited to general relationships because of sparse data on the causal
mechanisms of mortality. If gap models are to be used to explore
community dynamics under changing climates, the limitations and
shortcomings of these mortality algorithms must be identified and the

treatment of mortality in gap models, evaluate the relationships used to
represent mortality in the current generation of gap models, and then
assess the prospects for making improvements, especially for
applications involving global climate change. Three needs are identified
to improve mortality simulations in gap models: (1) process-based
empirical analyses are needed to create more climate-sensitive
stochastic mortality functions, (2) fundamental research is required to
quantify the biophysical relationships between mortality and plant
dynamics, and (3) extensive field data are needed to quantify,

The review is rather lengthy, and it has therefore been prepared in effect as two papers. There is a shorter, largely nontechnical version, which gives a quick impression of the current and future issues in the analysis of uncertainty in water quality modeling. Enclosed by this shorter discussion is the main body of the review dealing in turn with (1) identifiability and experimental design, (2) the generation of preliminary model hypotheses under conditions of sparse, grossly uncertain field data, (3) the selection and evaluation of model structure, (4) parameter estimation (model calibration), (5) checks and balances on the identified model, i.e., model "verification" and model discrimination, and (6) prediction error propagation. Much time is spent in discussingth e algorithms of systemi dentification, in particular, the methods of recursive estimation, and in relating these algorithms and the subject of identification to the problems of prediction uncertainty and first-order error analysis. There are two obvious omissions from the review. It is not concerned primarily with either the development and solution of stochastic differential equations or the issue of decision making under uncertainty, although clearly some reference must be made to these topics. In brief, the review concludes (not surprisingly) that much work has been done on the analysis of uncertainty in the development of mathematical models of water quality, and much remains to be done. A lack of model identifiability has been an outstanding difficulty in the interpretation and explanation of past observed system behavior, and there is ample evidencet o show that the "larger," more "comprehensive"m odels are easily capable of generatingh ighly uncertain predictions of future behavior. For the future of the subject, it is speculated that there is the possibility of progress in the development of novel algorithms for model structure identification, a need for new questions to be posed in the problem of prediction, and a distinct challenge to the conventional viewso f this reviewi n the new forms of knowledger epresentationa nd manipulationn ow emergingf rom the field of artificial intelligence},

abstract = {In ecology much attention has been paid towards seed dispersal of
fleshy-fruited plants, however, knowledge is lacking about the Iona-term
demographic consequences of variation in dispersal distance and fruit
removal rate, particularly given the natural variability of the
environment the organism lives in. In this study we used a spatially
explicit, two-level stochastic computer model to simulate population
dynamics of a fleshy-fruited shrub living in the sub-canopy of solitary
savanna trees. On the landscape level we implemented three realistic
scenarios of savanna landscape dynamics for a period of 500 years with
equal inter-annual mean of environmental variables. The first scenario
is representative of a relatively constant environment with normal
variability in precipitation, constant tree density and random tree
recruitment pattern. The second and third scenarios represent positive
auto-correlated, cyclic patterns with alternating phases of tree cover
increase and decrease corresponding with favorable and unfavorable rain
phases. Our simulation experiments show that when fruit removal rate is
extremely low, population persistence is enhanced under relatively
constant rain conditions, while alternating rain phases of the cyclic
scenarios lead to a significant population decrease. This result
confirms previous findings that periodically fluctuating environments
may increase local extinction risk. However, when dispersal distance is
a limiting factor (whilst removal rate was sufficiently high), tree

abstract = {We characterized recent historical and current vegetation composition and structure of a representative sample of subwatersheds on all ownerships within the interior Columbia River basin and portions of the Klamath and Great Basins. For each selected subwatershed, we constructed historical and current vegetation maps from 1932 to 1966 and 1981 to 1993 aerial photos, respectively. Using the raw vegetation attributes, we classi{\textregistered}ed and attributed cover types, structural classes, and potential vegetation types to individual patches within subwatersheds. We characterized change in vegetation spatial patterns using a suite of class and landscape metrics, and a spatial pattern analysis program. We then translated change in vegetation patterns to change in patterns of vulnerability to wild{\textregistered}res, smoke production, and 21 major forest pathogen and insect disturbances. Results of change analyses were reported for province-scale ecological reporting units (ERUs). Here, we highlight signi{\textregistered}cant {\textregistered}ndings and discuss management implications. Twentieth century management activities signi{\textregistered}cantly altered spatial patterns of physiognomies, cover types and structural conditions, and vulnerabilities to {\textregistered}re, insect, and pathogen disturbances. Forest land cover expanded in several ERUs, and woodland area expanded in most. Of all physiognomic conditions, shrubland area declined most due to cropland expansion, conversion to semi- and non-native herblands, and expansion of forests and woodlands. Shifts from early to late seral conifer species were evident in forests of most ERUs; patch sizes of forest cover types are now smaller, and current land cover is more fragmented. Landscape area in old multistory, old single story, and stand initiation forest structures declined with compensating increases in area and connectivity of dense, multilayered, intermediate forest structures. Patches with medium and large trees, regardless of their structural af{\textregistered}liation are currently less abundant on the landscape. Finally, basin forests are now dominated by shade-tolerant conifers, and exhibit elevated fuel loads and severe {\textregistered}re behavior attributes indicating expanded future roles of certain defoliators, bark beetles, root diseases, and stand replacement {\textregistered}res. Although well intentioned, 20th-century management practices did not account for landscape-scale patterns of living and dead vegetation that enable forest ecosystems to maintain their structure and organization through time, or for the disturbances that create and maintain them. Improved understanding of change in vegetation spatial patterns, causative factors, and links with disturbance processes will assist managers and policymakers in making informed decisions about how to address important ecosystem health issues.},

abstract = {Underlying dynamic event processes unfolding in continuous time give rise to spatiotemporal patterns that are sometimes observable at only a few discrete times. Such event processes may be modulated simultaneously over several spatial (e.g., latitude and longitude) and temporal (e.g., age, calendar time, and cohort) dimensions. The ecological challenge is to understand the dynamic latent processes that were integrated over several dimensions (space and time) to produce the observed pattern: a so-called inverse problem. An example of such a problem is characterizing epidemiological rate processes from spatially referenced age-specific prevalence data for a wildlife disease such as chronic wasting disease (CWD). With age-specific prevalence data, the exact infection times are not observed, which complicates the direct estimation of rates. However, the relationship between the observed data and the unobserved rate variables can be described with likelihood equations. Typically, for problems with multiple timescales, the likelihoods are integral equations without closed forms. The complexity of the likelihoods often makes traditional maximum-likelihood approaches untenable. Here, using seven years of hunter-harvest prevalence data from the CWD epidemic in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Wisconsin, USA, we develop and explore a Bayesian approach that allows for a detailed examination of factors modulating the infection rates over space, age, and time, and their interactions. Our approach relies on the Bayesian ability to borrow strength from neighbors in both space and time. Synthesizing a number of areas of event time analysis (current-status data, age/period/cohort models, Bayesian spatial shared frailty models), our general framework has very broad ecological applicability beyond disease prevalence data to a number of important ecological event time analyses, including general survival studies with multiple time dimensions for which existing methodology is limited. We observed strong associations of infection rates with age, gender, and location. The infection rate appears to be increasing with time. We could not detect growth hotspots, or location by time interactions, which suggests that spatial variation in infection rates is determined primarily by when the disease arrives locally, rather than how fast it grows. We emphasize assumptions and the potential consequences of their violations.},

We also sampled canopy bulk density, biomass, and cover for each plot in the grid. The spatial distribution and variability of surface and canopy fuel characteristics are described using the variance, spatial autocorrelation, semi-variograms, and Moran's I. We found that all fuels had high variability in loading (two to three times the mean), and this variability increased with the size of fuel particle. We also found that fuel components varied at different scales, with fine fuels varying at scales of 1 to 5 m, coarse fuels at 10 to 150 m, and canopy fuels at 100 to 500 m.

But in countries with high population density such as China and Japan, more than 95% of the forest fire disasters are caused by human activities. Furthermore, with the development of society, the wildland-urban interface (WUI) area is becoming more and more populated, and the forest fire is much connected with urban fire. Therefore exploring the scaling behavior of fires dominated by human-related factors is very challenging. The present paper explores the temporal scaling behavior of forest fires and urban fires in Japan. Our findings point out that although the human factors are the main cause, both the forest fires and urban fires exhibit time-scaling behavior.

Branchwood surface area, in particular, has significant implications for many ecophysiological processes including total respiration and interception of radiation and rainfall. Branch surface area was estimated at the branch-, tree-, and stand-level for 33 Douglas-fir (Pseduotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) plantations in the Oregon Coast Range. Patterns in WAI, leaf area index (LAI; total surface area of needles per unit of land area), tree area index (TAI=WAI + LAI) and various ratios of these dimensions were then investigated. The main axes of primary branches (those attached to the main stem) comprised 82±13% of total branchwood surface area. Tree surface area (needles + woody tissue) increased with increasing tree size and crown length, and decreased with greater intensity of Swiss needle cast (SNC). At the standlevel, woody surface area increased with greater stand density and decreased with more severe SNC, but on average it constituted 29±12% of total tree surface area. Branchwood surface area and bole surface area contributed equally toWAI. The variation inWAI for a given LAI has important implications for radiation and rainfall attenuation in these stands and for accurate partitioning of intercepted radiation between photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues.},

Here we study spatial patterns of five frugivore-dispersed tropical tree species at the Barro Colorado Island forest, Panama, to describe detailed properties of the spatial patterns of recruits and to investigate whether these patterns were produced by temporally consistent mechanisms. Our spatial point pattern analyses detected the existence of surprising spatial structures, such as double-cluster and superposition patterns, and they allowed for a detailed quantification of their properties. The spatial recruitment patterns were composed of two independent components comprising a random component and a component showing a complex spatial pattern with two critical scales of clustering. The analysis allowed an estimation of the relative contribution of scatter dispersal versus clump dispersal in effective seed dispersal for our study species. Additionally, the cluster characteristics were temporally consistent over 25 years and correlated with several species traits. We are just beginning to discover the richness of spatial patterns found at tropical forests, and we are confident that a combination of advanced point pattern analysis with field data will allow for significant advances in establishing the link between spatial patterns and processes.},

abstract = {We simulated fuel reduction treatments on a 16,000 ha study area in Oregon, US, to examine tradeoffs between placing fuel treatments near residential structures within an urban interface, versus treating stands in the adjacent wildlands to meet forest health and ecological restoration goals. The treatment strategies were evaluated by simulating 10,000 wildfires with random ignition locations and calculating burn probabilities by 0.5 m flame length categories for each 30 m 30 m pixel in the study area. The burn conditions for the wildfires were chosen to replicate severe fire events based on 97th percentile historic weather conditions. The burn probabilities were used to calculate wildfire risk profiles for each of the 170 residential structures within the urban interface, and to estimate the expected (probabilistic) wildfire mortality of large trees (>53.3 cm) that are a key indicator of stand restoration objectives. Expected wildfire mortality for large trees was calculated by building flame length mortality functions using the Forest Vegetation Simulator, and subsequently applying these functions to the burn probability outputs. Results suggested that treatments on a relatively minor percentage of the landscape (10%) resulted in a roughly 70% reduction in the expected wildfire loss of large trees for the restoration scenario. Treating stands near residential structures resulted in a higher expected loss of large trees, but relatively lower burn probability and flame length within structure buffers. Substantial reduction in burn probability and flame length around structures was also observed in the restoration scenariowhere fuel treatments were located 5–10 km distant. These findings quantify off-site fuel treatment effects that are not analyzed in previous landscape fuel management studies. The study highlights tradeoffs between ecological management objectives on wildlands and the protection of residential structures in the urban interface. We also advance the application of quantitative risk analysis to the problem of wildfire threat assessment.},

abstract = {Identifying the key processes affecting movement behaviour is essential
to understand the high variability of dispersal rates and their
influence on population dynamics in most arthropod communities.
Biological characteristics of the species, the type and the size of
local landscape elements and their spatial arrangements are important
for the dispersal of epigeic arthropods. We developed two
individual-based models to investigate dispersal activities of ground
beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae). The first model was used for simulation
experiments with high numbers of the forest carabid Carabus coriaceus
dispersing through heterogeneous habitats. In these experiments the
effects of local spatial resistance on movement was varied and the
subsequent reaction on the dispersal pattern was measured. The results
indicated that local spatial resistance determined the ability of ground
beetles to colonise new habitats and had an important impact on the
spatial distribution of the population. In a second model, the
connectivity of landscape elements, such as hedgerows and stepping
stones, was investigated for the forest carabids Abax parallelepipedus
and Carabus hortensis. We demonstrated that for Abax parallelepipedus
the width of the hedgerows determines the dispersal success.
Reproduction success in the local landscape elements was found a key
factor: it had to be higher than the potential losses by movements onto
suboptimal habitats. With Carabus hortensis, a faster disperser, the
simulations illustrated that hedgerows and stepping stones were of less
importance. Due to its lower densities and a higher probability to cross
large suboptimal areas, stochastic processes gained in importance for
dispersal. Linking the individual properties and behavioural reactions
to landscape structure facilitated the possibility to understand complex
arthropod dispersal processes at the population level. The results
indicated the necessity to analyse the dynamics of dispersal processes
on broader spatio-temporal scales over several generations. (c) 2005

Based on the classification, a discriminant analysis was performed on coincident upper-air sounding data from Spokane, Washington. It was found that a discriminant rule using the dewpoint depression at 85 kPa and the temperature difference between 85 and 50 kPa was able to classify correctly between 56% and 80% of the convective days as dry or wet. Also, composite maps of upper-air data showed distinctly different synoptic patterns among dry days, wet days, and all days.

abstract = {In the West, thinning and partial cuttings are being considered for treating millions of forested acres that are overstocked and prone to wildfire. The objectives of these treatments include tree growth redistribution, tree species regulation, timber harvest, wildlife habitat improvement, and wildfire-hazard reduction. Depending on the forest type and its structure, thinning has both positive and negative impacts on crown fire potential. Crown bulk density, surface fuel, and crown base height are primary stand characteristics that determine crown fire potential. Thinning from below, free thinning, and reserve tree shelterwoods have the greatest opportunity for reducing the risk of crown fire behavior. Selection thinning and crown thinning that maintain multiple crown layers, along with individual tree selection systems, will not reduce the risk of crown fires except in the driest ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) forests. Moreover, unless the surface fuels created by using these treatments are themselves treated, intense surface wildfire may result, likely negating positive effects of reducing crown fire potential. No single thinning approach can be applied to reduce the risk of wildfires in the multiple forest types of the West. The best general approach for managing wildfire damage seems to be managing tree density and species composition with well-designed silvicultural systems at a landscape scale that includes a mix of thinning, surface fuel treatments, and prescribed fire with proactive treatment in areas with high risk to wildfire.},

abstract = {This systematic review and harmonization of life cycle assessments
(LCAs) of utility-scale coal-fired electricity generation systems
focuses on reducing variability and clarifying central tendencies in
estimates of life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Screening 270
references for quality LCA methods, transparency, and completeness
yielded 53 that reported 164 estimates of life cycle GHG emissions.
These estimates for subcritical pulverized, integrated gasification
combined cycle, fluidized bed, and supercritical pulverized coal
combustion technologies vary from 675 to 1,689 grams CO2-equivalent per
kilowatt-hour (g CO2-eq/kWh) (interquartile range {[}IQR]= 8901,130 g
CO2-eq/kWh; median = 1,001) leading to confusion over reasonable
estimates of life cycle GHG emissions from coal-fired electricity
generation. By adjusting published estimates to common gross system
boundaries and consistent values for key operational input parameters
(most importantly, combustion carbon dioxide emission factor {[}CEF]),
the meta-analytical process called harmonization clarifies the existing
literature in ways useful for decision makers and analysts by
significantly reducing the variability of estimates (-53% in IQR
magnitude) while maintaining a nearly constant central tendency (-2.2%
in median). Life cycle GHG emissions of a specific power plant depend on
many factors and can differ from the generic estimates generated by the
harmonization approach, but the tightness of distribution of harmonized
estimates across several key coal combustion technologies implies, for
some purposes, first-order estimates of life cycle GHG emissions could
be based on knowledge of the technology type, coal mine emissions,
thermal efficiency, and CEF alone without requiring full LCAs. Areas
where new research is necessary to ensure accuracy are also discussed.},

abstract = {Sequoia sempervirens (redwood) is a long-lived, shade-tolerant tree capable of regeneration without disturbances and thus often present in all sizes within a single forest. In order to evaluate functional linkages among structures, plant distribution, and biodiversity in the canopy, we quantified all vascular plants from ground level to the treetops in an oldgrowth redwood forest (Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, California, USA). This involved mapping terrestrial and epiphytic trees, shrubs, and ferns as well as climbing 27 trees up to 101 m tall within a 1-ha plot. We monitored canopy microclimates using sensor arrays that collected hourly data for up to 30 months. The plot held 4283 Mg/ha of aboveground dry mass in living plants, 95.4% of which was contributed by redwood. A high degree of structural complexity and individuality was evident in the crowns of the 14 largest trees in the form of reiterated trunks arising from main trunks, other trunks, and limbs. Thirteen species of vascular plants occurred as epiphytes in the plot, and all but one of these were restricted to the 14 largest trees. The evergreen shrub Vaccinium ovatum had the highest biomass of any epiphyte (212 kg/ha) followed by the evergreen fern Polypodium scouleri (196 kg/ha). The spatial aggregation of reiterated trunks was highly coincident with epiphyte masses, explaining 92% of the variation in fern and 75% of the variation in woody plant distribution along the vertical gradient. In addition to epiphyte biomass, there were 2366 kg/ha of soil in the canopy. Soils in crotches held 2–4 times as much water as soils on branches or limbs, and deeper layers held more water than shallower layers. During two years of monitoring, the volume of water stored in dead wood and soils in the canopy fluctuated between 24.7 m3 and 53.4 m3/ha. The vast majority of the plot's structure and arboreal habitats was held in the crowns of the 14 largest trees. Reiterated trunks and limbs on a small number of trees have important ecological functions in old-growth redwood forests, and it may be feasible to accelerate the development of structural complexity and biodiversity in maturing redwood stands.},

abstract = {Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it infl ates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identifi cation of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a diff erent or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors diff er between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, diff erent approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with fi ve predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifi cally designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the fi nal interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the ‘ folk lore ' -thresholds of correlation coeffi cients between predictor variables of |r|  0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. Th e use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.},

abstract = {Despite its widespread occurrence globally, wild. re preferentially occupies an environmental middle ground and is significantly less prevalent in biomes characterized by environmental extremes (e. g., tundra, rain forests, and deserts). We evaluated the biophysical "environmental space'' of wild. re from regional to subcontinental extents, with methods widely used for modeling habitat distributions. This approach is particularly suitable for the biogeographic study of wild. re, because it simultaneously considers patterns in multiple factors controlling wild. re suitability over large areas. We used the Maxent and boosted regression tree algorithms to assess wild. re-environment relationships for three levels of complexity (in terms of inclusion of variables) at three spatial scales: the conterminous United States, the state of California, and five wild. re-prone ecoregions of California. The resulting models were projected geographically to obtain spatial predictions of wild. re suitability and were also applied to other regions to assess their generality and spatial transferability. Predictions of the potential range of wild. re had high classification accuracy; they also highlighted areas where wild. res had not recently been observed, indicating the potential (or past) suitability of these areas. The models identified several key variables that were not suspected to be important in the large-scale control of wild. res, but which might indirectly affect control by influencing the presence of inflammable vegetation. Models transferred to different areas were useful only when they overlapped appreciably with the target area's environmental space. This approach should allow exploration of the potential shifts in wild. re range in a changing climate, the potential for restoration of wild. re where it has been "extirpated,'' and, conversely, the "invasiveness'' of wild. re after changes in plant species composition. Our study demonstrates that habitat distribution models and related concepts can be used to characterize environmental controls on a natural disturbance process, but also that future work is needed to re. ne our understanding of the direct causal factors controlling wild fire at multiple spatial scales.},

important lessons to learn from the past, we believe that we cannot

to present ideas that could be useful in developing plans under
changing climates that could be applicable to forests with

when considering the effects of changing climates. Such a goal relaxes
expectations that current species ranges will remain constant, or that
population abundances, distribution, species compositions and

processes to operate within forested landscapes will be critical.
Management and political institutions will have to acknowledge and

abstract = {Fire regimes result from reciprocal interactions between vegetation and fire that may be further affected by other disturbances, including climate, landform, and terrain. In this paper, we describe fire and fuel extensions for the forest landscape simulation model, LANDIS-II, that allow dynamic interactions among fire, vegetation, climate, and landscape structure, and incorporate realistic fire characteristics (shapes, distributions, and effects) that can vary within and between fire events. We demonstrate the capabilities of the new extensions using two case study examples with very different ecosystem characteristics: a boreal forest system from central Labrador, Canada, and a mixed conifer system from the Sierra Nevada Mountains (California, USA). In Labrador, comparison between the more complex dynamic fire extension and a classic fire simulator based on a simple fire size distribution showed little difference in terms of mean fire rotation and potential severity, but cumulative burn patterns created by the dynamic fire extension were more heterogeneous due to feedback between fuel types and fire behavior. Simulations in the Sierra Nevada indicated that burn patterns were responsive to topographic features, fuel types, and an extreme weather scenario, although the magnitude of responses depended on elevation. In both study areas, simulated fire size and resulting fire rotation intervals were moderately sensitive to parameters controlling the curvilinear response between fire spread and weather, as well as to the assumptions underlying the correlation between weather conditions and fire duration. Potential fire severity was more variable within the Sierra Nevada landscape and also was more sensitive to the correlation between weather conditions and fire duration. The fire modeling approach described here should be applicable to questions related to climate change and disturbance interactions, particularly within locations characterized by steep topography, where temporally or spatially dynamic vegetation significantly influences spread rates, where fire severity is variable, and where multiple disturbance types of varying severities are common.},

The effectiveness of fuelbreaks remains a subject of debate because of differing fuelbreak objectives, prescriptions for creation and maintenance, and their placement in landscapes with differing {\textregistered}re regimes. A well-designed fuelbreak will alter the behavior of wildland {\textregistered}re entering the fuel-altered zone. Both surface and crown {\textregistered}re behavior may be reduced. Shaded fuelbreaks must be created in the context of the landscape within which they are placed. No absolute standards for fuelbreak width or fuel reduction are possible, although recent proposals for forested fuelbreaks suggest 400 m wide bands where surface fuels are reduced and crown fuels are thinned. Landscape-level treatments such as prescribed {\textregistered}re can use shaded fuelbreaks as anchor points, and extend the zone of altered {\textregistered}re behavior to larger proportions of the landscape. Coupling fuelbreaks with area-wide fuel treatments can reduce the size, intensity, and effects of wildland {\textregistered}res},

abstract = {Modeling the long-term effects of intensive forest biomass harvesting scenarios over time, including the more complete removal of tree tops and branches, is a scientific and policy need. Yet, due to our incomplete understanding about complex forest ecosystems, model simulations are to various degrees uncertain. In this study we first modified a well-evaluated and widely used ecosystem model – CENTURY 4.5 – to model management scenarios that retain various sizes and quantities of small-diameter woody material after intensive biomass harvests. Second, we used a global sensitivity analysis approach to evaluate the sensitivity of nine model outputs to 55 parameters, grouped into 17 factors. The values of the parameters were generated with a normal distribution and sampled with the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test. Our analysis indicated that within a harvest rotation, the model output sensitivity varied over years in response to different factors. The model was most sensitive to factors consisting of temperature effects on potential production as well as N deposition and non-symbiotic N fixation. In response to the uncertain parameter values, the model simulation revealed that outputs of net N mineralization rates in slow and passive soil organic matter pools had the highest uncertainties. However, due to the very low fraction of the N supplied from these two pools, forest production and other simulations were not strongly affected, ending with overall variations less than 6%. Ultimately, this study exhibits a novel approach in modeling the effects of harvesting fine woody debris for bioenergy on long-term ecosystem C and N cycles, and illustrates that sensitivity testing the most uncertain parameters is crucial for minimizing model uncertainty.},

abstract = {Animal foraging may be influenced by multiple demands simultaneously (eg., nutrient gain and predator avoidance). Conventional approaches to understand the trade-ofii between these demands require cramming them in ffmilar currencies, which is impractical in many field situations. We introduce a new method, called multiobjective programming, as a framework to explore how animals balance conflicting demands. Multiobjective programming allows one to explore die influence of foraging demands directly, without explicit assumptions about how they enter into fitness and without conversion to some common currency. Using multiobjective programming, we show that, as foraging demands change, animait may adaptivety adjust their behavior, even if the constraints on feasible behavior are unaffected (contrary to die predictions of the conventional models). Hence, we may see a variable response in foraging that is consistent with adaptive behavior. We used an empirical test with herbivore grasshoppers and predator spiders to evaluate die utility of multiobjective programming Our experiments show that grasshoppers are able to optimally balance die foraging objectives of energy intake and vigilance under changing levels of predation risk. The multiobjective model is used both to evaluate die biological «ignifiranrf of the broad variation that was observed in die grasshoppers' foraging behavior and to quantify explicitly die trade-off between energy intake and predator avoidance.

abstract = {The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) is a native insect of the pine forests of western North America, and its populations periodically erupt into large-scale outbreaks. During outbreaks, the resulting widespread tree mortality reduces forest carbon uptake and increases future emissions from the decay of killed trees. The impacts of insects on forest carbon dynamics, however, are generally ignored in large-scale modelling analyses. The current outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, is an order of magnitude larger in area and severity than all previous recorded outbreaks. Here we estimate that the cumulative impact of the beetle outbreak in the affected region during 2000-2020 will be 270 megatonnes (Mt) carbon (or 36 g carbon m(-2) yr(-1) on average over 374,000 km2 of forest). This impact converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak. In the worst year, the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in British Columbia were equivalent to approximately 75% of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of Canada during 1959-1999. The resulting reduction in net primary production was of similar magnitude to increases observed during the 1980s and 1990s as a result of global change. Climate change has contributed to the unprecedented extent and severity of this outbreak. Insect outbreaks such as this represent an important mechanism by which climate change may undermine the ability of northern forests to take up and store atmospheric carbon, and such impacts should be accounted for in large-scale modelling analyses.},

@article{Shugart2002,
abstract = {Computer models designed to simulate the dynamics of a forest by following the fates of each individual tree in a forest stand were created initially in the mid-1960s. The earliest such model was built by Newnham (1964), followed by similar developments in several Schools of Forestry in the US. These early models involved using a digital computer to dynamically change a map of the sizes and positions of each tree in a simulated forest. Importantly, these initial models were as complex and detailed as their present day descendants. With increased computing power becoming cheap and available, applications using these models have become increasingly frequent (Shugart and West, 1980). Gap models simulate the changes in a small patch of forest on the order of 0.1 ha in size. The models project the annual growth of each individual tree on the patch as well as the death of each tree and the regeneration of new individual trees. Gap models are important because of their widespread applications in assessing the effects of environmental change on forests. The models have been applied to develop theories about the overall functioning of forested landscape and have also been used to reconstruct the composition of forests of the past and under future conditions. Gap models are a special case of the more general individual-based models. They have been used particularly for forest ecosystems. Because gap models have been applied in a very wide range of ecosystems, often the term, gap model, is used interchangeably with other individual-based model when applied to mix age and multi-species ecosystems. The models simulate landscapes as dynamically changing mosaics with each element of the mosaic having an interactive population of trees of different species and sizes. Output from the models resembles field data as sampled from a standard forest survey unit: a list of the diameters of each tree (and its species) alive on the patch for each year. These model data can be transformed to estimates of biomass (and hence, net production), leaf area profiles through the canopy, and tree ring histories for each trees.},

abstract = {Monitoring and inventory to assess the effects of wildland fire is critical for 1) documenting fire effects, 2) assessing ecosystem damage and benefit, 3) evaluating the success or failure of a burn, and 4) appraising the potential for future treatments. However, monitoring fire effects is often difficult because data collection requires abundant funds, resources, and sampling experience. Often, the reason fire monitoring projects are not implemented is because fire management agencies do not have scientifically based, standardized protocols for inventorying pre- and postfire conditions that satisfy their monitoring and management objectives. We have developed a comprehensive system, called the Fire Effects Monitoring and Inventory System (FIREMON), which is designed to satisfy fire management agencies' monitoring and inventory requirements for most ecosystems, fuel types, and geographic areas in the United States. FIREMON consists of standardized sampling methods and manuals, field forms, database, analysis program, and an image analysis guide so that fire managers can 1) design a fire effects monitoring project, 2) collect and store the sampled data, 3) statistically analyze and summarize the data, 4) link the data with satellite imagery, and 5) map the sampled data across the landscape using image processing. FIREMON allows flexible but comprehensive sampling of fire effects so data can be evaluated for significant impacts, shared across agencies, and used to update and refine fire management plans and prescriptions. FIREMON has a flexible structure that allows the modification of sampling methods and local code fields to allow the sampling of locally important fire effects evaluation criteria.},

abstract = {In this article, basic concepts of both genetic algorithms and evolution program design are presented. An evolution program is presented to solve a Model I harvest scheduling problem with 0-1 decision variables for the management alternatives for each stand, with annual constraints on harvested volume. An appropriate data structure (i.e., chromosome representation) is presented, as well as modified selection, crossover, and mutation strategies specially designed for application to large forest scheduling problems. Emphasis is on designing an efficient evolution program to address the complexity of large integer problem model solving and to provide both strategic and operational guidance to forest managers. A new stopping criterion for this iterative heuristic based on the asymptotic behavior of the evolution process is further presented. The new evolution program is applied to a two-product timber harvest scheduling problem in Portugal with a temporal horizon extending to seventy 1 yr periods. Results from 50 test computer runs are discussed for application to this large problem encompassing approximately 122,000 binary integer variables and 1,000 constraints. Statistic analysis of the convergence process suggests that the evolution program may seek optimal solutions at reasonable computational cost. Results thus suggest that evolutionary techniques may be used to confront the complexity of integer forest management scheduling model solving.},

@article{Waller2003,
abstract = {One often develops stochastic ecologic simulation models based on local interactions between individuals or groups and bases systemic conclusions on trends summarized over multiple data sets generated from the model. In many cases, such models generate data sets (“realizations”) each violating the usual assumptions associated with traditional statistical tests of goodness-of-fit, most notably that of independent observations. Monte Carlo hypothesis tests applied to multiple realizations from such models provide appropriate goodness-of-fit tests regardless of within-model peculiarities. The Monte Carlo tests address the question “Do the observed data appear consistent with the model?” in contrast to the usual question “Does the model appear consistent with the observed data?”. In addition, such tests can make use of the same data sets used to draw systemic inference (i.e. the tests require no additional simulation runs). We illustrate the concept using Pearson's chi-square statistic with correlated data. We also consider the behavior of a similar statistic and of “modeling efficiency” in assessing the fit of a simulation model for the spatial spread of raccoon rabies in Connecticut.},

abstract = {Surprise takes many forms, all tending to disrupt plans and planning systems. Reliance by decision makers on formal analytic methodologies can increase susceptibility to surprise as such methods commonly use available information to develop single-point forecasts or probability distributions of future events. In doing so, traditional analyses divert attention from information potentially important to understanding and planning for effects of surprise. The authors propose employing computer-assisted reasoning methods in conjunction with simulation models to create large ensembles of plausible future scenarios. This framework supports a robust adaptive planning (RAP) approach to reasoning under the conditions of complexity and deep uncertainty that normally defeat analytic approaches. The authors demonstrate, using the example of planning for long-term global sustainability, how RAP methods may offer greater insight into the vulnerabilities inherent in several types of surprises and enhance decision makers' ability to construct strategies that will mitigate or minimize the effects of surprise.},

@incollection{Swetnam1996,
abstract = {Fire-scar chronologies from a network of 63 sites in the Southwestern United States are listed and described. These data characterize the natural range and variability of fire regimes from low elevation pine forests to higher elevation mixed-conifer forests since AD 1700. A general pattern of increasing length of intervals between low intensity surface fires was observed along gradients of low to high elevations, and from the relatively drier pine sites to the wetter mixed-conifer sites. However, large variability in the measures of central tendency and higher moments of the fire interval distributions suggest that elevation and forest type were often weak determinants of fire frequency. Some of the variations in fire interval distributions between similar elevation or forest types were probably due to unique site characteristics, such as landscape connectivity (Le., ability of fires to spread into the sites), and land-use history. Differences in the sizes of sampled areas and fire-scar collections among the sites also limited our ability to compare and interpret fire interval summary statistics. Comparison of both the fire-scar network data (1700 to 1900) and documentary records of area burned on all Southwestern Region National Forests (1920 to 1978) with a Palmer Drought Severity Index time series clearly shows the association between severe droughts and large fire years, and wet periods and small fire years. Moreover, important lagging relations between climate and fire occurrence are also revealed. In particular, large fire years in ponderosa pine dominated forests were typically preceded by wet conditions in the prior one to three years. In contrast, large fire years in mixed-conifer forests were associated with extreme drought years, but no consistent lagging relations were observed. We hypothesize that both fuel production (especially grasses and pine needles) and fuel moisture were important climate-linked factors in ponderosa pine fire regimes, while fuel moisture was the primary factor controlling mixed-conifer fire regimes. These results provide two important types of information for management: (1) Baselines of fire regime ranges and variations are documented across the most economically important and widespread forest types in the Southwest. These data will be useful for guiding, developing, and justifying ecosystem management plans, particularly for the restoration of fire regimes and forest structures to improve forest health and sustainability. (2) The fire-climate relations suggest that a long-range fire hazard forecasting model could be developed that would be a valuable tool for planning and implementing both pprescribed fire and fire suppression programs in the Southwest.},

abstract = {The extreme cost of fighting wildland fires has brought fire suppression expenditures to the forefront of budgetary and policy debate in the United States. Inasmuch as large fires are responsible for the bulk of fire suppression expenditures, understanding fire characteristics that influence expenditures is important for both strategic fire planning and onsite fire management decisions. These characteristics then can be used to produce estimates of suppression expenditures for large wildland fires for use in wildland fire decision support or after-fire reviews. The primary objective of this research was to develop regression models that could be used to estimate expenditures on large wildland fires based on area burned, variables representing the fire environment, values at risk, resource availability, detection time, and National Forest System region. Variables having the largest influence on cost included fire intensity level, area burned, and total housing value within 20 mi of ignition. These equations were then used to predict suppression expenditures on a set of fiscal year 2005 Forest Service fires for the purpose of detecting “extreme” cost fires—those fires falling more than 1 or 2 SDs above or below their expected value.},

abstract = {We summarized structure and composition of dry forests from a 90-year-old timber inventory collected by the Bureau of Indian Affairs on the former Klamath Indian Reservation (now part of the Fremont- Winema National Forest). This analysis includes data from 424,626 conifers P15 cm dbh on 3068 transects covering 6646 ha. The data represent a 10–20% sample of 38,651 ha of forest growing on sites that are classified as ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and mixed-conifer habitat types distributed within the 117,672 ha of the study area. Large, drought- and fire-tolerant ponderosa pine dominated these forests. Large tree (>53 cm dbh) basal area (13 ± 7 m2/ha) contributed 83 ± 16% of total basal area; 81 ± 20% of the large-tree basal area was ponderosa pine. Composition and structure of forests on mixed-conifer sites were very similar to those on ponderosa pine sites. Variability in composition and structure was recorded on all habitat types and was highest on moist mixed-conifer sites. Stand densities (trees per hectare, tph) have more than tripled over the past 90 years from 68 ± 28 tph to a current density of 234 ± 122 tph recorded in Current Vegetation Survey data collected by the United States Forest Service. Mean basal area, however, increased by less than 20%. Basal area of large trees (>53 cm dbh) has declined by >50%, and the abundance of large trees as a proportion of the total number of trees per hectare has decreased by more than a factor of five. This landscape-level record of historical forest conditions allows inferences about structure and composition across tens of thousands of hectares. A historical landscape emerges which supports current working hypotheses that frequent, low- to moderate-severity wildfires maintained a predominantly low-density forest dominated by large, fire- and drought-tolerant ponderosa pines across a significant moisture and productivity gradient from the driest ponderosa pine to the mixed-conifer habitat types.},

abstract = {Vegetation and the water cycles are inherently coupled across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Water availability interacts with plant ecophysiology and controls vegetation functioning. Concurrently, vegetation has direct and indirect effects on energy, water, carbon, and nutrient cycles. To better understand and model plant–water interactions, highly interdisciplinary approaches are required. We present an overview of the main processes and relevant interactions between water and plants across a range of spatial scales, from the cell level of leaves, where stomatal controls occur, to drought stress at the level of a single tree, to the integrating scales of a watershed, region, and the globe. A review of process representations in models at different scales is presented. More specifically, three main model families are identified: (1) models of plant hydraulics that mechanistically simulate stomatal controls and/or water transport at the tree level; (2) ecohydrological models that simulate plot- to catchment-scale water, energy, and carbon fluxes; and (3) terrestrial biosphere models that simulate carbon, water, and nutrient dynamics at the regional and global scales and address feedback between Earth's vegetation and the climate system. We identify special features and similarities across the model families. Examples of where plant–water interactions are especially important and have led to key scientific findings are also highlighted. Finally, we discuss the various data sources that are currently available to force and validate existing models, and we present perspectives on the evolution of the field.},

abstract = {The development of automated (computer-based) calibration methods has focused mainly on the selection of a singleobjective measure of the distance between the model-simulated output and the data and the selection of an automatic optimization algorithm to search for the parameter values which minimize that distance. However, practical experience with model calibration suggests that no single-objective function is adequate to measure the ways in which the model fails to match the important characteristics of the observed data. Given that some of the latest hydrologic models simulate several of the watershed output fluxes (e.g. water, energy, chemical constituents, etc.), there is a need for effective and efficient multiobjective calibration procedures capable of exploiting all of the useful information about the physical system contained in the measurement data time series. The MOCOM-UA algorithm, an effective and efficient methodology for solving the multipleobjective global optimization problem, is presented in this paper. The method is an extension of the successful SCE-UA single-objective global optimization algorithm. The features and capabilities of MOCOM-UA are illustrated by means of a simple hydrologic model calibration study.},

abstract = {The impact of forest fires on nature and civilisation is conflicting: on one hand, they play an irreplaceable role in the natural regeneration process, but on the other hand, they come within the major natural hazards in many regions. Their frequency-area distributions show power-law behaviour with scaling exponents alpha in a quite narrow range, relating wildfire research to the theoretical framework of self-organised criticality. Examples of self-organised critical behaviour can be found in computer simulations of simple cellular automaton models. The established self-organised critical Drossel-Schwabl forest fire model is one of the most widespread models in this context. Despite its qualitative agreement with event-size statistics from nature, its applicability is still questioned. Apart from general concerns that the Drossel-Schwabl model apparently oversimplifies the complex nature of forest dynamics, it significantly overestimates the frequency of large fires. We present a modification of the model rules that distinguishes between lightning-induced and man made forest fires and enables a systematic increase of the scaling exponent alpha by approximately 1/3. In addition, combined simulations using both the original and the modified model rules predict a dependence of the overall event-size distribution on the ratio of lightning induced and man made fires as well as a splitting of their partial distributions. Lightning is identified as the dominant mechanism in the regime of the largest fires. The results are confirmed by the analysis of the Canadian Large Fire Database and suggest that lightning-induced and man made forest fires cannot be treated separately in wildfire modelling, hazard assessment and forest management},

However, to achieve desired outcomes in a fiscally responsible manner, the cost and effectiveness in reducing losses due to wildland fire of different fuel treatments in different forest settings must be understood. Currently, prioritizing fuel treatment activities and planning budget expenditures is limited by a lack of accurate cost data. The primary objective of this research was to develop regression models that may be used to estimate the cost of hazardous fuel reduction treatments based on USDA Forest Service Region, biophysical setting, treatment type, and design. A survey instrument was used to obtain activity-specific information directly from fire management officers at Forest Service Ranger Districts for treatments occurring between 2001 and 2003. For both prescribed burns and mechanical activities, treatment size described the largest amount of variation in cost per acre, with increased size reducing cost per acre, on average. We confirmed that data on Forest Service fuel treatment activities maintained in the National Fire Plan Operations and Reporting System were not sufficiently accurate for reasonable cost analysis and modeling.},

abstract = {The inventory and monitoring of coarse woody debris (CWD) carbon (C) stocks is an essential component of any comprehensive National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NGHGI). Due to the expense and difficulty associated with conducting field inventories of CWD pools, CWD C stocks are often modeled as a function of more commonly measured stand attributes such as live tree C density. In order to assess potential benefits of adopting a field-based inventory of CWD C stocks in lieu of the current model-based approach, a national inventory of downed dead wood C across the U.S. was compared to estimates calculated from models associated with the U.S.'s NGHGI and used in the USDA Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis program. The model-based population estimate of C stocks for CWD (i.e., pieces and slash piles) in the conterminous U.S. was 9 percent (145.1 Tg) greater than the field-based estimate. The relatively small absolute difference was driven by contrasting results for each CWD component. The model-based population estimate of C stocks from CWD pieces was 17 percent (230.3 Tg) greater than the field-based estimate, while the model-based estimate of C stocks from CWD slash piles was 27 percent (85.2 Tg) smaller than the field-based estimate. In general, models overestimated the C density per-unit-area from slash piles early in stand development and underestimated the C density from CWD pieces in young stands. This resulted in significant differences in CWD C stocks by region and ownership. The disparity in estimates across spatial scales illustrates the complexity in estimating CWD C in a NGHGI. Based on the results of this study, it is suggested that the U.S. adopt field-based estimates of CWD C stocks as a component of its NGHGI to both reduce the uncertainty within the inventory and improve the sensitivity to potential management and climate change events.},
annote = {Inventorying coarse woody debris (CWD) and carbon stocks are a vital element of the National Greenhouse GAs Inventory (NGHGI). These attributes are hard to physically measure so stocks are modeled as a function of more commonly known or, measured attributes. This study concluded that coarse woody debris carbon density is not entirely a function of the forest stands carbon stocks. Many factors complicate the relationship between live and dead carbon wood stocks. The models in this study may provide plausible coarse woody debris carbon population at the national scale but does introduce some bias into the model. The models will always predict coarse woody debris carbon stocks wherever the live tree carbon stocks are well understood. However, the models greatly underestimate the coarse woody debris carbon stocks when morality events result in low live carbon stocks. We can use this to show that there is some uncertainty in the modeling of fuels.},

This project is part of larger-scale, small-diameter tree thinning covering an area of 607km2 over a 10-yr period. Although the Nutrioso Project encompasses 213km2 of mixed ownerships, only National Forest lands (79%) will be treated. A variety of thinning and fire prescriptions have been established depending on slopes, road access, and distance from private land. The mostly small-diameter (o12 cm) trees in ponderosa pine and mixed conifer stands are being removed under a ‘‘Stewardship Contract'' for utilization in small power plants (o3 MW), and a wood-heating pellet manufacturing facility. The outlet for the wood fuel pellets is the growing market for house and business heating, and co-generation fuel in a 615MW coal-fired power station.

abstract = {The Pareto Optimal Model Assessment Cycle (POMAC), a multiple-criteria model assessment methodology, is described for exploring uncertainty in the relationships between ecological theory, model structure, and assessment data. Model performance is optimized to satisfy, simultaneously, each component of a vector of assessment criteria (model outputs), rather than the usual procedure of optimizing performance with respect to a single criterion. Pareto Optimality is used to define the vector optimization. The Pareto Optimal Set reveals which combinations of assessment criteria the model can satisfy simultaneously. Binary interval error measures, which classify whether a parameterization result is within an acceptable range of values, are defined for each criterion. Their use masks small differences in the performance of different parameterizations, allowing the Pareto Optimal Set to reveal conflicts in ability to achieve simultaneously different collections of criteria. POMAC improves the researcher's ability to detect deficiencies and locate their sources. It is more stringent and informative than traditional model assessment procedures because it uses multiple criteria without weighting and aggregating them. The Pareto Optimal Set reveals the presence of deficiencies through the model's inability to satisfy all the criteria simultaneously. POMAC then guides the researcher in locating deficiencies in: inadequate selection of component ecological hypotheses underlying the model, inadequate mathematical representations of these hypotheses, inadequate parameterization, poor selection and formulation of the assessment criteria, or combinations of these. In an example, POMAC is applied to the spatially explicit canopy competition model WHORL using ten assessment criteria. Each criterion was selected to provide information on different aspects of WHORL's functioning: three stand height distribution criteria, three crown morphology criteria, and four criteria focusing on stand competition's characteristic differentiation of growth rates. The Pareto Optimal Set was generated using simulated evolution optimization. POMAC revealed deficiencies in both the model structure and its assessment criteria, leading to an improved model and better understanding of its effective domain.},

abstract = {Allometric approaches based only on tree diameter at breast height (DBH) have been used to estimate leaf biomass and leaf area index (LAI) in coniferous forests. This approach has been suggested to sometimes produce unrealistically high LAI estimates, notably in old-growth stands in the Paci{\textregistered}c Northwest (PNW). Leaf area to sapwood area relationships offer an alternative basis for estimating LAI and a number of empirical and modeling approaches have been used for generating treelevel sapwood area and leaf area estimates. To evaluate effects of the alternative assumptions among these approaches, we compared {\textregistered}ve algorithms for estimating leaf area per tree and stand-level LAI in stands dominated by Douglas-{\textregistered}r (Pseudotsuga menziesii var menziesii). Initially, 383 trees representing the major species and the complete range of tree sizes in the study area were examined for species, DBH, crown ratio, and sapwood area. There were signi{\textregistered}cant species-speci{\textregistered}c relationships between sapwood and DBH for these trees. Neither crown ratio nor the ratio of observed tree height to expected tree height were effective in predicting the sign and magnitude of the residuals in the sapwood area/DBH relationships. Nine stands (three young, three mature, and three old-growth) in and near the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the western central Oregon Cascades were then studied with species, DBH, and crown ratio recorded for all trees in a set of subplots. At the stand level, the LAI algorithms based on sapwood area at breast height produced signi{\textregistered}cantly lower LAI estimates than the DBH-alone algorithm in mature and old-growth stands. The algorithm relying on estimated sapwood area at the base of the crown further reduced LAI estimates relative to those based on sapwood area at breast height. Although the differences between the DBH-based and sapwood area-based approaches tended to be greatest in the older stands, estimated LAI was higher in the older stands than in the younger stands for all algorithms. Comparative studies using allometric, litterfall, and optical approaches to LAI estimation are needed to resolve issues such as trends in LAI with succession and maximum possible LAI in Douglas-{\textregistered}r forests. # 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The goal of this work is to evaluate by a modeling approach the effectiveness of alternative fuel treatment strategies to reduce potential losses from wildfires in Mediterranean areas. We compared strategic fuel treatments located near specific human values vs random locations, and treated 3, 9 and 15% of a 68,000 ha study area located in Sardinia, Italy. The effectiveness of each fuel treatment was assessed by simulating 25,000 wildfires using the MTT fire spread algorithm. The simulations replicated severe wildfires observed around the study area, using historic weather and fuel moisture conditions (97th percentile). Wildfire exposure profiles for the study area as a whole and for locations with specific values of interest were analyzed. Results indicated significant variations in wildfire exposure among and within the fuel management strategies and treatment intensities. The simulated mitigation strategies substantially decreased the average wildfire exposure with respect to the untreated condition, and this effect was unequivocal for all strategies. Increasing the percentage of land treated improved the effectiveness of all fuel treatment strategies. The strategy based on road protection provided the highest performances for several wildfire exposure indicators. The methodology presented in this work can be applied to facilitate the design of fuel management programs and support policy decisions to address growing wildfire risk in the region. This work is one of the first applications of fire simulation modeling to evaluate fuel management effectiveness on wildfire risk mitigation in the Mediterranean areas.},

abstract = {Fire suppression has resulted in dramatic changes to species composition and structural diversity in the Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forests. We need a better understanding of how these forests have changed during the fire suppression era, but empirical historical datasets are rare and methodologies for developing new historical reference information are subject to limitations. We sought to develop historical reference information for the Yosemite Forest Dynamics Plot (YFDP), a research plot located in an old-growth mixed-conifer forest in Yosemite National Park. We performed a dendrochronologial fire history analysis to characterize the historical fire regime of the YFDP, resulting in an estimated pre-1900 point fire return interval of 29.5 years. We then developed two different forest reconstruction models to estimate structural and compositional forest changes since 1900, the year the last widespread fire burned the YFDP, to the present. We explored the use of two different tree growth models—a regionally parameterized competition-dependent model and a parsimonious site-specific model—as well as a decay model based on published estimates of wood decay rates. The competition-dependent growth model predicted slightly higher stem densities (175 trees ha1 vs. 112 trees ha1 in 1900) and slightly lower basal area (20.9 m2 ha1 vs. 24.1 m2 ha1 in 1900) than the site-specific growth model. Predictions about dead trees, especially large diameter sugar pines, are potentially inaccurate, both in this study and other reconstruction studies in the Sierra Nevada, due to a lack of size-specific snag and log decay rate data. Our study highlights the need for more detailed decay data for Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forests. While reconstruction models are constrained by the data used to parameterize them, they can still produce estimates of historical conditions that are useful for understanding the direction and magnitude of forest change, as well as for planning forest management. Our analysis demonstrates dramatic changes in forest conditions since fire-exclusion—a clear ecological basis for restoration. We encourage managers to focus on restoring key ecological processes that maintain ecosystem structure and function, in this case fire, rather than attempting tree-for-tree recreations of historical structure without reintroducing fire.},

Wildfires are becoming more severe in stands where trees are densely stocked with shade-tolerant understory trees.

Our research quantitatively examined fire effects in treated and untreated stands in western United States national forests. Four ponderosa pine sites in Montana, Washington, California and Arizona were selected for study. Fuel treatments studied include: prescribed fire only, whole-tree thinning, and thinning followed by prescribed fire. Onthe- ground fire effects were measured in adjacent treated and untreated forests. We developed post facto fire severity and stand structure measurement techniques to complete field data collection. We found that crown fire severity was mitigated in stands that had some type of fuel treatment compared to stands without any treatment. At all four of the sites, the fire severity and crown scorch were significantly lower at the treated sites. Results from this research indicate that fuel treatments, which remove small diameter trees, may be beneficial for reducing crown fire hazard in ponderosa pine sites},

abstract = {Wildfires are a serious problem affecting many terrestrial ecosystems and causing substantial economic damage. Understanding the variation in structure of fuels (which is predominantly represented by plant litter and live vegetation) is key to understanding the behaviour of wildland fires. An understanding of changes to fuels as vegetation develops is also central to the management of both wildfire and the planning of prescribed burning. A description of fuel structure is required for all models of fire behaviour. It is therefore important that we have an appropriate system for describing fuel structure and predicting how fuel structure will develop through time (i.e. fuel succession). In this paper we review the range of published models used for fuel description and fuel succession. We propose an object-orientated database as an appropriate method for storing the complex data structures that are needed to process and analyse data on fuels. The potential advantages of an object-orientated database as a tool for modelling fuel succession are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Fish density models are essential tools for fish ecologists and
fisheries managers. However, applying these models can be difficult
because of high levels of model complexity and the large number of
parameters that must be estimated. We designed a simple fish density
model and tested whether it could predict fish densities in lotic
systems with meaningful levels of accuracy and precision. We built our
6-parameter model on 2 key assumptions: 1) fish population density is a
power function of mean body mass (i.e., the self-thinning relationship),
and 2) energetic resources are transferred from lower to higher trophic
levels at a nearly constant rate (i.e., trophic transfer efficiency). We
estimated the self-thinning and trophic transfer efficiency parameters
by randomly sampling from values reported in the primary literature.
Remaining parameters were net primary production, trophic level, the
production:biomass ratio, and mean body mass. We used empirical
parameter estimates and fish density estimates to test the model in 4
warm-water and 4 cold-water systems. Model accuracy was high in 3 test
systems (deviations between the model-predicted densities and
empirically observed densities <30%), moderate in 3 test systems
(deviations 75-111%), and low in 2 systems (deviations >150%). Model
precision was low (e.g., the interquartile ranges of model-predicted
densities encompassed similar to 1 order of magnitude), but appropriate
for predicting fish densities at coarse spatial and temporal scales. We
concluded that the model is a potentially useful and efficient tool, and
we provide recommendations for applying the model. In particular, we
emphasize that the model is scalable, and therefore, well-suited for
estimating fish densities at large spatial scales. We also point out
that the model is a carrying capacity model, and therefore, can be used
to predict fish densities in undisturbed systems or to approximate
reference conditions.},

abstract = {Quercus eduardii and Q. potosina are the most abundant tree species of
the temperate forests of Sierra Fria, Aguascalientes, Mexico, in an area
ranging between 2200 and 2600 m above see level. During the last century
these clonal oaks were intensively exploited to obtain charcoal and
firewood for local use; in addition, sections of the forest were
transformed into grasslands for livestock. The effects of disturbance on
the population dynamics of these species are poorly known. Therefore, a
demographic study was carried out in order to: (a) evaluate the effects
of disturbance on the population growth rate of these species; (b)
assess the effects of inter-annual environmental variability on the long
term population dynamics; (c) evaluate the relative importance of sexual
reproduction and clonal propagation on population growth rate; (d)
simulate the impact of different levels of tree harvesting on the
population dynamics of these species, and (e) recommend a harvesting
intensity, based on the information obtained above. Annual, mean and
periodic matrices as well as stochastic simulations were used. These
size-classified population matrix models also were employed to devise a
schedule that maximizes the percentage of individual plants that can be
harvested without affecting their population growth rates. For this
reason specific entries of the matrices were modified to simulate
different harvesting intensities. The study was carried out in two
disturbed and two undisturbed sites during a 4-years period. Two plots
were established inside each site; one plot was excluded from livestock
and the other was left intact. Annual population growth rates were above
or equal to unity in all sites, species and years, whereas mean,
periodic and stochastic simulation matrix models showed no significant
differences between species, years, sites or from unity, suggesting that
logging and grazing did not have a negative effect on the population
growth rate of these species. Both species produced clonal offspring
during the 4 years of the study, but reproduced sexually only once,
suggesting a masting reproduction. Elasticity analyses showed that the
contribution of clonal propagation is more important than fecundity to
the population growth rate of both species. Mean annual and periodic
matrix models showed that extractions as low as 5% cause a population
decline, while with stochastic simulations extractions of up to 5% are
possible for both species; however, the environmental stochasticity will
drive populations to local extinctions. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier

It describes constraint relations on dynamics between systems of different scale. It is useful in describing parts and wholes, and processes taking place in such complex structures. The other, the specification hierarchy, is an older discourse dating back to Plato, and, as a theory of development, to Aristotle. In the twentieth century it was relegated to peripheral importance in biology, but has continued to inform social science and psychology. It can be represented as a system of nested classes, the outermost class containing the most general phenomena, the innermost the most highly specified. These integrative levels can be considered as stages of development as well. Each new stage transcends the one before it and integrated it into a new whole. Incredibly, the same statements can be made about a system from these two viewpoints, even though their meanings are logically different.},

We examine the use of a regionalized sensitivity analysis procedure to select appropriate values for parameters in cases where only sparse, imprecise data are available. The utility of the method is examined in the context of equilibrium and dynamic models for describing water quality and hydrological data in a small catchment in Shehandoah National Park, Virginia.

The model incorporates both environmental and human factors, including vegetation, temperature, precipitation, human structures, and transportation. Spatial autocorrelation was examined for both fire activity and vegetation to determine the specification of neighborhood effects in the model. Parameters were estimated using stepwise logistic regressions. Among the explanatory variables, the variable that represents the neighborhood effects of spatial processes is shown to be of great importance in the distribution of wildland fires. An important implication of this result is that the management of wildland fires must take into consideration neighborhood effects in addition to environmental and human factors. The distribution of fire occurrence probability is more accurately mapped when the model incorporates the spatial term of neighborhood effects. The map of fire occurrence probability is useful for designing large-scale management strategies of wildfire prevention.},

Beyond the unpredictability of wildfire behavior, uncertainty stems from inaccurate/missing data, limited resource value measures to guide prioritization across fires and resources at risk, and an incomplete scientific understanding of ecological response to fire, of fire behavior response to treatments, and of spatiotemporal dynamics involving disturbance regimes and climate change. This work attempts to systematically align sources of uncertainty with the most appropriate decision support methodologies, in order to facilitate cost-effective, risk-based wildfire planning efforts. We review the state of wildfire risk assessment and management, with a specific focus on uncertainties challenging implementation of integrated risk assessments that consider a suite of human and ecological values. Recent advances in wildfire simulation and geospatial mapping of highly valued resources have enabled robust risk-based analyses to inform planning across a variety of scales, although improvements are needed in fire behavior and ignition occurrence models. A key remaining challenge is a better characterization of non-market resources at risk, both in terms of their response to fire and how society values those resources. Our findings echo earlier literature identifying wildfire effects analysis and value uncertainty as the primary challenges to integrated wildfire risk assessment and wildfire management. We stress the importance of identifying and characterizing uncertainties in order to better quantify and manage them. Leveraging the most appropriate decision support tools can facilitate wildfire risk assessment and ideally improve decision-making.},

However, it is found that the frequencyinterval distribution of actual forest fires is not exponential, but a power law with periodical fluctuations which may be caused by the daily cycle of weather parameters. Therefore, a weather driven forest fire model WD model is built considering actual hourly weather records, with which the fire igniting probability is calculated. The simulation results indicate that the frequency-interval distribution of the WD model agrees with that of actual forest fire data and, at the same time, the frequency-size distributions of the WD and the DS models are in accordance with each other. In the further analysis of the temporal property of weather data, it is found that the change of weather data also exhibits a power-law relation with periodic fluctuations, implying that the external driving from weather parameters is the essential reason for the power-law distribution of fire intervals. The results suggest that natural systems may be coupled with each other and that the decoupling of systems is important to identifying system characteristics.},

Still, the adoption of density-based methods has been limited so far, possibly because they are relatively more difficult to implement. Here we present a novel GSA method, called PAWN, to efficiently compute density-based sensitivity indices. The key idea is to characterise output distributions by their Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDF), which are easier to derive than PDFs. We discuss and demonstrate the advantages of PAWN through applications to numerical and environmental modelling examples. We expect PAWN to increase the application of density-based approaches and to be a complementary approach to variance-based GSA.},

abstract = {Individual-based models (IBMs) have been improved in quality and reliability in recent years with an approach called pattern-oriented modelling (POM). POM proposes guidelines to develop models reproducing multiple patterns observed on the field and to test systematically how well the IBMs reproduce them. POM studies used generally traditional methods of goodness of fit such as the sum of squares evaluation or ad hoc comparisons of fitting errors and variations. Model selection, however, can be a rigorous statistical approach based on information theory and information criteria such as the Akaike's information criterion (AIC) or the deviance information criterion (DIC). So far, it has not been tried to link POM to these rigorous techniques. The main problems to achieve that are: (a) the difficulty to have likelihood functions for IBMs' parameters and (b) the possibility to obtain posterior distributions of IBMs' parameters given the patterns to reproduce. In a first part, this paper answers problem (a) by proposing and explaining how to calculate a deviance measure (POMDEV) for models developed in a context of POM. And while answering the second problem, a second part of the paper proposes an information criterion for model selection in a POM context (the pattern-oriented modelling information criterion: POMIC). This criterion does not yet have the same theoretical foundation as, e.g., AIC, but uses formal analogies to the DIC. In a third part POMIC is tested with a modelling exercise. This exercise shows the potential of POMIC to use multiple patterns for selecting among multiple potential submodels and eventually select the most parsimonious and well fitting model version. We conclude that POMIC, although being a heuristically derived approach, can greatly improve the POM framework. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new method for producing a functional–structural plant model that simulates response to different growth conditions, yet does not require detailed knowledge of underlying physiology. The example used to present this method is the modelling of the mountain birch tree. This new functional–structural modelling approach is based on linking an L-system representation of the dynamic structure of the plant with a canonical mathematical model of plant function. Growth indicated by the canonical model is allocated to the structural model according to probabilistic growth rules, such as rules for the placement and length of new shoots, which were derived from an analysis of architectural data. The main advantage of the approach is that it is relatively simple compared to the prevalent process-based functional–structural plant models and does not require a detailed understanding of underlying physiological processes, yet it is able to capture important aspects of plant function and adaptability, unlike simple empirical models. This approach, combining canonical modelling, architectural analysis and L-systems, thus fills the important role of providing an intermediate level of abstraction between the two extremes of deeply mechanistic process-based modelling and purely empirical modelling. We also investigated the relative importance of various aspects of this integrated modelling approach by analysing the sensitivity of the standard birch model to a number of variations in its parameters, functions and algorithms. The results show that using light as the sole factor determining the structural location of new growth gives satisfactory results. Including the influence of additional regulating factors made little difference to global characteristics of the emergent architecture. Changing the form of the probability functions and using alternative methods for choosing the sites of new growth also had little effect.},

A total of 274 fuelbeds were created and parameterized, and can be input into FCCS to obtain fire potentials, surface fire behavior and carbon biomass for each fuelbed. To assess the results, FCCS was used to calculate the carbon biomass of each fuelbed, and the results were compared to the values obtained for four other regional or global biomass products. The results showed reasonable agreement both in terms of geographical distribution and biomass loads when compared to other biomass data, with the best results found for Tropical and Boreal forests (Spearman's coefficient of 0.79 and 0.77). This global fuel dataset could be used for a varied range of applications, including fire danger assessment, fire behavior estimations, fuel consumption calculations and emissions inventories.},

Here we analyzed satellite imagery and prescribed fire records from two Arizona wildfires that occurred in 2002, finding that prescribed fire treatments reduced wildfire severity and changed its progress. Prescribed burning in ponderosa pine forests 1–9 years before the Rodeo and Chediski fires reduced fire severity compared with untreated areas, despite the unprecedented 1860-km2 combined wildfire sizes and record drought. Fire severity increased with time since treatment but decreased with unit size and number of repeated prescribed burn treatments. Fire progression captured by Landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+) clearly showed the fire circumventing treatment units and protecting areas on their lee side. This evidence is consistent with model predictions that suggest wildland fire size and severity can be mitigated by strategic placement of treatments.},

abstract = {Among the huge array of hypogeous ectomycorrhizal fungi so far
documented from Australia, six genera and more than 30 species occur
within the family Mesophelliaceae, all of which show various
adaptations for surviving in fire-prone landscapes. These mostly
endemic fungi are critical to postfire reestablishment of regenerating
vegetation, and their fruit-bodies provide essential food resources for
diverse ground-dwelling fauna. We developed habitat models for five
common representatives of the mesophelliaceae based on repeat
collections of their fruit-bodies from 136 study plots situated along a
series of environmental gradients across the south-eastern mainland of
Australia. At a meso- or landscape scale, temperature influenced the
occurrence of Castoreum radicatum, Mesophellia clelandii and
Nothocastoreum cretaceum, with the type of response varying. Below a
threshold, C. radicatum preferred sites with cooler mean annual
temperatures. In contrast, M. clelandii and N. cretaceum had optimal
ranges of temperature, above and below which the probability of
detecting them dropped. Also at a landscape scale, C. radicatum was
more likely to be detected at sites with lower levels of precipitation
during the driest quarter of the year. At a micro-site scale, M.
clelandii and N. cretaceum were more likely to occur in stands with an
intermediate number of host eucalypt stems, likely relating to
successional age of the stand. Sites with a higher number of large
fallen trees were more likely to have N. cretaceum, while sites with
intermediate litter depths were more likely to have C. radicatum and M.
clelandii. Mesophellia glauca and M. trabalis showed no consistent
patterns. They are apparently the most broadly adaptable in terms of
the independent variables tested. Although fire has been previously
suggested to be heavily implicated in the life cycle of several members
of the Mesophelliaceae, we found no relationship between time since
disturbance by fire and other factors and likelihood of occurrence.
Instead, other habitat attributes appeared to be more important in
explaining their distribution. The complex and differing responses of
the species of Mesophelliaceae studied here, to features of their
environment, reinforce the need to manage multiple-use forest
landscapes across the region for a diversity of attributes. (C) 2009

abstract = {Humans and climate affect ecosystems and their services, which may involve continuous and discontinuous transitions from one stable state to another. Discontinuous transitions are abrupt, irreversible and among the most catastrophic changes of ecosystems identified. For terrestrial ecosystems, it has been hypothesized that vegetation patchiness could be used as a signature of imminent transitions. Here, we analyse how vegetation patchiness changes in arid ecosystems with different grazing pressures, using both field data and a modelling approach. In the modelling approach, we extrapolated our analysis to even higher grazing pressures to investigate the vegetation patchiness when desertification is imminent. In three arid Mediterranean ecosystems in Spain, Greece and Morocco, we found that the patch-size distribution of the vegetation follows a power law. Using a stochastic cellular automaton model, we show that local positive interactions among plants can explain such power-law distributions. Furthermore, with increasing grazing pressure, the field data revealed consistent deviations from power laws. Increased grazing pressure leads to similar deviations in the model. When grazing was further increased in the model, we found that these deviations always and only occurred close to transition to desert, independent of the type of transition, and regardless of the vegetation cover. Therefore, we propose that patch-size distributions may be a warning signal for the onset of desertification.},

abstract = {An important decision in presence-only species distribution modeling is howto select background (or pseudo-absence) localities for model parameterization. The selection of such localities may influence model parameterization and thus, can influence the appropriateness and accuracy of the model prediction when extrapolating the species distribution across time and space.We used 12 species fromthe AustralianWet Tropics (AWT) to evaluate the relationship between the geographic extent from which pseudo-absences are taken and model performance, and shape and importance of predictor variables using the MAXENT modeling method. Model performance is lower when pseudo-absence points are taken from either a restricted or broad region with respect to species occurrence data than froman intermediate region. Furthermore, variable importance (i.e., contribution to the model) changed such that, models became increasingly simplified, dominated by just two variables, as the area from which pseudo-absence points were drawn increased. Our results suggest that it is important to consider the spatial extent from which pseudo-absence data are taken. We suggest species distribution modeling exercises should begin with exploratory analyses evaluating what extent might provide both the most accurate results and biologically meaningful fit between species occurrence and predictor variables. This is especially important when modeling across space or time—a growing application for species distributional modeling.},

abstract = {Modeling the impacts and effects of hazardous fuel reduction treatments is a pressing issue within the wildfire management community. Prospective evaluation of fuel treatment effectiveness allows for comparison of alternative treatment strategies in terms of socioeconomic and ecological impacts and facilitates analysis of tradeoffs across land-management objectives. Studies have yet to rigorously examine potential impacts to fire suppression expenditures associated with prior hazardous fuel reduction treatments. Such information would be helpful for federal land-management agencies struggling to contain escalating wildfire management costs. In this article we establish a methodology for estimating potential reductions in wildfire suppression costs. Our approach pairs wildfire simulation outputs with a regression cost model and quantifies the influence of fuel treatments on distributions of wildfire sizes and suppression costs. Our case study focuses on a landscape within the Deschutes National Forest in central Oregon that was selected to receive funding under the auspices of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program. Results suggest substantial reductions in distributions of wildfire size and suppression cost on a per fire basis. Furthermore, because fewer ignitions become large fires on the treated landscape, distributions of annual area burned and annual suppression costs also shift downward because of fuel treatments. Results are contingent on four key factors: large-scale implementation of fuel treatments across the landscape, assumed treatment effectiveness over the duration of the analysis period, accuracy of wildfire and cost models, and accuracy of projected changes to fire behavior fuel models resulting from fuel treatments. We discuss strengths and limitations of the modeling approach and offer suggestions for future improvements and applications.},

abstract = {Aim: Wildfire is often considered more severe now than historically in dry forests of the western United States. Tree-ring reconstructions, which suggest that histori- cal dry forests were park-like with large, old treesmaintained by low-severity fires, are from small, scattered studies. To overcome this limitation, we developed spa- tially comprehensive reconstructions across 927,000 ha in four landscapes, using a new method based on land surveys from c. 1880. Methods: We reconstructed forest structure for four large dry-forest landscapes using forest descriptions and tree data from historical land surveys.Usingmultiple elements of historical forest structure from this study along with corroborating information fromtree-ring studies, we were able to interpret past forest dynamics. Hypotheses concerning historical structure and dynamics were then tested. Results: These reconstructions show that dry forests were structurally variable, containing from 20 to over 1000 trees ha-1 and some dense understoreys of shrubs and small trees. Park-like stands of large trees maintained by low-severity fire predominated only in parts of the study landscapes.Only 3, 12, 40 and 62%of the four landscapes fit a low-severity fire model; 3897% had evidence of higher- severity (mixed- and high-severity) fire. Some large modern wildfires (e.g. Rodeo- Chediski), perceived as catastrophic, had fire severity congruent with historical variability. Main conclusions: Spatially extensive reconstructions from the late 1800s show that these forests were structurally variable, including areas of dense forests and understorey trees and shrubs, and fires varied in severity, including 1565% high- severity fire.A set of laws, policies and initiatives that aimto uniformly reduce fuels and fire severity is likely tomovemany of these forests outside their historical range of variability with adverse effects on biological diversity.Macroscale survey-based reconstructions and palaeoecological studies reveal that higher-severity fires were and are a part of the normal dynamics of dry forests.},

loss, and population isolation on the long-term persistence of many
species including the endangered Delmarva fox squirrel (Sciurus niger
cinereus), future changes in climate may make existing habitats less
productive and more variable. The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)
for the Delmarva Peninsula of the mid-Atlantic USA, reveals a trend for
longer durations of potentially unfavorable conditions for fox squirrel
population growth. We used a stochastic population matrix model and
available life history information to assess population extinction risk
for the Delmarva fox squirrel under a number of scenarios of landscape
change and environmental variation, including uncertainties in the
future range of climate patterns. Patch size (carrying capacity) was the
most important factor influencing persistence of isolated populations.
Extinction risk increased markedly across all patch sizes when year to
year patterns in environmental variability were autocorrelated to match
regional patterns in the PDSI. Increased autocorrelation matching the
regional PSDI increased extinction risk, ranging from a factor of 5 to a
factor of over 100 in some scenarios when compared to uncorrelated
patterns in environmental variability. Increasing the range of variation
in survival probabilities was less important to persistence, but its
effect also increased when year-to-year changes were autocorrelated in
time. Comparing model results with the size and landscape configuration
of currently occupied patches on the Delmarva Peninsula showed that many
existing populations are above the size threshold identified by these
simulations for long-term persistence under current conditions, but
these may become vulnerable should climate variability increase and
adverse conditions persist for several years at a time. (c) 2007

abstract = {In many fire-prone forests in the United States, changes occurring in the last century have resulted in overstory structures, conifer densities, down woody structure and fuel loads that deviate from those described historically. With these changes, forests are presumed to be unsustainable. Broad-scale treatments are proposed to reduce fuels and promote stand development on trajectories toward more sustainable structures. Yet little research to date has identified the effects of these treatments, especially in low elevation dry ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests. We report initial fuelbed conditions and changes immediately and 4-6 years after fuel reduction treatments in an operational-scale, replicated (N = 4), completely randomized experiment in northeastern Oregon. Treatments included a single entry thin from below conducted in 1998, a late season burn conducted in 2000, a thin followed by burning (thin + burn), and a no action treatment which served as a control. Between 1998 and 2004, litter mass declined about 4.4 Mg ha-1 in thin units, about 4.1 Mg ha-1 in thin + burn units, and about 1.5 Mg ha-1 in burn units. Duff mass did not change with treatment. Mass of woody fuels in the 1 and 10 h timelag classes increased in thin units immediately after treatment, but fell to nearly pre-treatment levels by 2004. Mass of woody fuels in the 100 h timelag class increased about 1.6 Mg ha-1 in thin units, and decreased about 0.7 Mg ha-1 in burn units and about 0.1 Mg ha-1 in thin + burn units. There was no difference in the change in total woody fuel mass among all treatments. About 62% of the residual trees in the burn and the thin + burn units were charred; charring extended up the bole about 1.1 m. About 50% of the residual trees in the burn and thin + burn units had scorched lower crowns. Mean scorch height was 4.3 m. Log density was greater in control units compared to actively treated units and greater in the thin units compared to burn or thin + burn units. We used the Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS) to construct a representative fuelbed for each unit from inventoried data and to calculate three indices of fire potential as measures of the change in fire hazard resulting from our treatments: surface fire behavior, crown fire behavior, and fuels available for consumption. Projected flame length, rate of spread, and reaction intensity are derived as metrics of future surface fire behavior. These results are discussed in the context of management options for restoration of ecosystem health in similar low elevation dry ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir forests.},

However, current decision analysis approaches, such as comparative risk assessment, benefit-cost analysis, and life cycle assessment, do not offer a comprehensive approach for incorporating the varied types of information and multiple stakeholder and public views that must typically be brought to bear when new technologies are under consideration. Alternatively, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) offers a scientifically sound decision framework for management of contaminated materials or sites where stakeholder participation is of crucial concern and criteria such as economics, environmental impacts, safety, and risk cannot be easily condensed into simple monetary expressions. This article brings together a multidisciplinary review of existing decision-making approaches at regulatory agencies in the United States and Europe and synthesizes state-of-the-art research in MCDA methods applicable to the assessment of contaminated sediment management technologies. Additionally, it tests an MCDA approach for coupling expert judgment and stakeholder values in a hypothetical contaminated sediments management case study wherein MCDA is used as a tool for testing stakeholder responses to and improving expert assessment of innovative contaminated sediments technologies.},

abstract = {Prescribed fire is increasingly being viewed as a valuable tool for mitigating the ecological consequences of long-term fire suppression within fire-adapted forest ecosystems. While the use of burning treatments in northern temperate conifer forests has at times received considerable attention, the long-term (>10 years) effects on forest structure and development have not been quantified. We describe the persistence of prescribed fire effects in a mature red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.)-dominated forest in northern Minnesota, USA over a $\sim$50 year period, as well as the relative roles of fire season and frequency in affecting individual tree and stand-level structural responses. Burning treatments were applied on 0.4 ha compartments arranged in a randomized block design with four blocks. Burning treatments crossed fire season (dormant, summer) and frequency (annual, biennial, and periodic), and include an unburned control for comparison. Treatments were applied from 1960 to 1970, with no further management interventions occurring since. Data were collected periodically from 1960 to 2014.Forest structural development trajectories were significantly altered by the application of fire treatments. Burning treatments led to lower overstory densities, lower stand basal area, and larger tree diameters when compared to the unburned control over the study period. Differences between burning treatments were less apparent suggesting that the application of burning itself rather than a particular season and/or frequency of burning drives this long-term response. Overstory tree mortality and stand growth showed little or no response to burning treatments. In addition, we detected no impact of burning on long-term overstory tree growth efficiency (based on assessments >40 years post burning) suggesting these treatments had little cumulative effect on tree vigor. Our results indicate that the effects of burning treatments on structural dynamics are not ephemeral, but rather alter stand development trajectories in the long-term. The persistent nature of these effects highlights their potential as a tool for long-lasting structural alterations in treated stands without compromising overstory tree growth and vigor. The lack of red pine recruitment throughout the duration of the study suggests that prescribed fire alone cannot regenerate this species, and that further alteration to overstory and seedbed conditions would be needed to secure new cohorts of this species.},

abstract = {When conducting sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, most of the global sensitivity techniques assume parameter independence. However, it is common that the parameters are correlated with each other. For models with correlated inputs, we propose that the contribution of uncertainty to model output by an individual parameter be divided into two parts: the correlated contribution (by the correlated variations, i.e. variations of a parameter which are correlated with other parameters) and the uncorrelated contribution (by the uncorrelated variations, i.e. the unique variations of a parameter which cannot be explained by any other parameters). So far, only a few studies have been conducted to obtain the sensitivity index for a model with correlated input. But these studies do not distinguish between the correlated and uncorrelated contribution of a parameter. In this study, we propose a regression-based method to quantitatively decompose the total uncertainty in model output into partial variances contributed by the correlated variations and partial variances contributed by the uncorrelated variations. The proposed regression-based method is then applied in three test cases. Results show that the regression-based method can successfully measure the uncertainty contribution in the case where the relationship between response and parameters is approximately linear. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, human population interaction pattern obtained using Newton's gravity model are combined with a forest age and species fuel layer to assess the wildfire potential distribution in the Southeastern Mississippi fire district. Gravity model predictions are compared with a previously developed road density model, and validated against 5 year observational data. Highest human activity patterns are predicted in densely populated areas and are aligned along the highways. The fuel and human activity maps are almost complimentary in the high population region, which validates the intrusive nature of human settlement and their role in redefining land use. The human activity pattern acts as a wildfire ignition source, and the highest wildfire probability is predicted for areas with dense fuel and scattered human populations. The gravity model performs better than the density model for low- and high-risk zones, whereas the latter performs better than the former in medium-risk zones, when compared with the historical data. The study emphasizes the need for improved wildfire prediction models including enhanced depictions of human activity patterns, and the need for integration of a meteorology condition layer.},

abstract = {I present examples of plant functional–structural models (FSMs) that are used to evaluate how foliage units affect whole-canopy functions, and I show that multi-criteria optimization is an effective tool for these models. FSMs produce plant structures through the repeated application of a set of rules for the placement of foliage units. The models are blind (rules are the same regardless of dynamic simulation conditions), sighted (rules change with interference from other foliage units) or self-regulatory (rules change depending on the conditions of the simulation, i.e., internal conditions). In the examples presented, the models are used to optimize plant morphology for one or more measures of plant performance; these measures include movement of materials and associated hydraulic functions, foliage display, light interception and net carbon, mechanical support and stability, and reproductive success. It is consistently found that no morphology is optimal for any single measure of plant performance, and the rules for plant development are not stationary in space and time. In multi-criteria optimization, alternative morphologies are compared against multiple measures of plant performance; these are optimized simultaneously using Pareto optimality, which yields the set of mutually co-dominant solutions not dominated by any other solution. Two solutions are considered to be mutually co-dominant if improvement with respect to one criterion is at the expense of another criterion. I conclude that multi-criteria optimization is an essential tool for the use of FSMs to relate processes at the foliage level to whole-canopy function and to explain the structural diversity of old-growth forests},

The solid flame model is used, in which the flame is regarded as a uniformly-radiating surface with a simple geometry. Case studies are presented, ranging from the relatively simple case of planar or cylindrical flames to the case of the more complex geometries of irregular flame fronts where the strategy consists in approximating the front as a collection of individual solid flames. Model results are in good agreement with available data. An attempt is made to estimate the radiant heat flux ahead of a fire front spreading on a heterogeneous landscape. Finally the model is applied to determine the defensible space around a structure in which combustible vegetation has been totally cleared in the aim of reducing the wildfire threat to homes.

abstract = {A maximum pseudo-likelihood approach has previously been developed for fitting pairwise interaction models to patterns generated by growth-interaction processes that are sampled at fixed time points. This approach is now extended, not only by estimating the parameters of the process through time, but also by employing least squares estimation since likelihood based approaches are much more computationally demanding. First, simple stochastic models are used to demonstrate that least squares methods are as powerful as likelihood-based approaches, as well as being mathematically and computationally simpler. The algorithm generates simulations of the deterministic growth-interaction and stochastic immigration-death process, and through these the parameter estimates are determined. Logistic and linear growth are then combined with (symmetric) disc-interaction and (asymmetric) area-interaction processes, and between them these generate a variety of mark-point spatial structures. A robustness study shows that the procedure works well in that the presence, structure and strength of a growth-interaction process can be determined even when an incorrectly presumed model is employed. Thus, the technique is likely to prove to be very useful in general practical applications where the underlying process generating mechanism is almost certain to be unknown. Finally, the procedure is applied to the analysis of a new Swedish pine forest data set for which tree location and diameter at breast height were recorded in 1985, 1990 and 1996. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We use a spatially correlated metric for fire co-occurrence between pairs of trees (the S{\o}rensen distance variogram), with output from a neutral model for fire history, to infer the relative strength of top-down vs. bottom-up controls on historical fire regimes. An inverse modeling procedure finds combinations of neutral-model parameters that produce S{\o}rensen distance variograms with statistical properties similar to those observed from two landscapes in eastern Washington, USA, with contrasting topography. We find the most parsimonious model structure that is able to replicate the observed patterns and the parameters of this model provide surrogates for the predominance of top-down vs. bottom-up controls. Simulations with relatively low spread probability produce irregular fire perimeters and variograms similar to those from the topographically complex landscape. With higher spread probabilities fires exhibit regular perimeters and variograms similar to those from the simpler landscape. We demonstrate that cross-scale properties of the fire-scar record, even without historical fuels and weather data, document how complex topography creates strong bottom-up controls on fire spread. This control is weaker in simpler topography, and may be compromised in a future climate with more severe weather events.},

abstract = {Despite its prevalent reporting in regional/national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGI), forest floor (FF) carbon (C) stocks (including litter, humus, and fine woody debris [FWD]) have not been empirically measured using a consistent approach across forests of the US. The goal of this study was to use the first national field inventory of litter and humic layer depths, along with FWD volumes, to assess their basic attributes (e.g., depths/volumes) and refine NGHGI approaches to FF C stock monitoring. Results suggest that FF C stocks are present in nearly 99% of US forests with a median estimate of 25.6. Mg/ha, albeit with tremendous spatial variation in litter/humic depths and FWD volumes. Relative to aboveground live tree biomass C stocks, which typically range from 20 to 200. Mg/ha, nearly a quarter of US forests have minor FF C stocks (<14. Mg/ha), while approximately 10% of US forests may have substantial FF C stocks (>93. Mg/ha). Conditions conducive to large FF C stocks may be stochastic disturbance events that result in high volumes of FWD and/or climatic/physiographic conditions that slow decomposition (e.g., peatland ecosystems found in northern or coastal forest ecosystems). As soil and dead wood field inventories may only sample litter/humic depths and FWD counts by diameter class, C stock estimation procedures are heavily reliant on estimation constants (e.g., bulk/wood density). It was found that the variability in estimation constants may have a much stronger effect on resulting FF C stock estimates than the field measurements (e.g., litter layer depths) themselves. The monitoring of FF C stocks, along with the maintenance of site productivity and associated ecosystem services, would benefit from refined sample protocols in ecosystems with deep humic layers and coupling field data with lab analysis of bulk/wood density and C content from soil sampling programs. ?? 2011.},

abstract = {A multi-criteria model evaluation protocol is presented to check the performance of rainfall-runoff models during model calibration and validation phases based on a high frequency (e.g. hourly, daily) river flow series. The multiple criteria or objectives are based on multiple and non-commensurable measures of information derived from river flow series by means of a number of sequential time series processing tasks. These include separation of the river flow series in subflows, split of the series in nearly independent quick and slow flow hydrograph periods, and the extraction of nearly independent peak and low flows. The protocol accounts for the statistical assumptions and requirements on independency and homoscedasticity of the model residuals, significantly advanced through the use of nearly independent flow values extracted from the flow series. Next to the separate evaluation of the subflow recessions, the quick and slow runoff peak and low values and event volumes, also the performance of the model in predicting extreme high and low flow statistics is validated. To support the time series processing tasks as well as the application of the multi-criteria model evaluation protocol, a Microsoft Excel-based tool (WETSPRO: Water Engineering Time Series PROcessing tool) has been developed. It is based on the assessment of graphical displays, which complement traditional goodness-of-fit statistics. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {To evaluate a specific form of resource management, for example, the maintenance of valuable cultural landscapes, the contributions of many different viewpoints must be considered. In this paper, a model for assessing and integrating the different aspects contributing to landscape evaluation is proposed. Some results of its use in landscape assessment in the Madrid region (central Spain) are discussed. The model takes into account five assessment dimensions which are considered to be independent—the ecological, productive, economic, social and cultural evaluative systems and it recognises and assumes conflicts and trade-offs between these components. The inclusion of the production system as an independent assessment dimension is original and is justified because it is the link that connects the ecological and economic systems. Since this dimension acts most directly on the ecosystem, the production system includes the attribute of ecological or strong (in the sense of [For the Common Good, Beacon Press, Boston, 1994]) sustainability. The evaluation method places special emphasis on defining a conceptual framework, and from this defines scenarios in comparison with which particular development models (landscape planning, resources management) can be evaluated. Seven scenarios, coming from a hypothetical, traditional sustainable scenario of resources management, are defined. One of these, the sound sustainable scenario, is defended as the only one viable in the long term, particularly in developing countries. This method was employed to evaluate the agricultural and natural landscape of the Madrid region municipalities. The multivariate approach adopted was based on the selection of indicator sets for each evaluative dimension. The structure of relationships among indicators was then analysed separately for each dimension and values assigned to the municipalities according to their position on the main axes of the multivariate analyses. Each municipality was assigned to one of the seven development scenarios by means of discriminant analysis. The approach's greatest assets are its flexibility in the selection of the indicators and the efficacy in its monitoring and comparison of the different analysed cases once a rigorous conceptual framework was established. The paper discusses the conditions for the sustainability of the human activities and provides a method for evaluating and comparing scenarios of resources management},

abstract = {Fire regimes are complex systems that represent an aggregate of spatial and temporal events whose statistical properties are scale dependent. Despite the breadth of research regarding the spatial controls on fire regime variability, few datasets are available with sufficient resolution to test spatially explicit hypotheses. We used a spatially distributed network of georeferenced fire-scarred trees to investigate the spatial structure of fire occurrence at multiple scales. Mantel's tests and geostatistical analysis of fire-occurrence time series led to inferences about the mechanisms that generated spatial patterns of historical fire synchrony (multiple trees recording fire in a single year) in eastern Washington, USA. The spatial autocorrelation structure of historical fire regimes varied within and among sites, with clearer patterns in the complex rugged terrain of the Cascade Range than in more open and rolling terrain further north and east. Results illustrate that the statistical spatial characteristics of fire regimes change with landform characteristics within a forest type, suggesting that simple relationships between fire frequency, fire synchrony, and forest type do not exist. Quantifying the spatial structures in fire occurrence associated with topographic variation showed that fire regime variability depends on both landscape structure and the scale of measurement. Spatially explicit fire-scar data open new possibilities for analysis and interpretation, potentially informing the design and application of fire management on landscapes, including hazardous fuel treatments and the use of fire for ecosystem restoration.},

Africa.
Terrestrial African mammals were allocated to major biomes, and regional
and local assemblages were extracted from published and unpublished
literature. We produced body size frequency distributions for local,
regional, biomic and continental distributions, both for whole
assemblages and for three foraging strata, and compared these with
several standard metrics (e.g. mean and median size, interquartile
range, skew, bimodality, etc.). Differences between distributions were
quantified using t-tests and analysis of variance.
African mammal faunas exhibit features in common with those of North and
South America, most notably the gradual reduction in the modality and
skew of body size distributions with decreasing spatial scale. Unlike
other continents, however, the African mammal fauna exhibits a bimodal
frequency distributions at all spatial scales. Our data suggest a role
for competitive interactions in local assembly, as documented elsewhere,
but further data on locally interacting assemblages are needed.
The African fauna appears unique in the expression of bimodality at all
spatial scales. The presence of a secondary mode at large body size may
reflect co-evolutionary adjustments to proto-human hunters and
consequent escape from anthropogenic Pleistocene extinctions, but the
absence of species of intermediate body size (c. 250-4000 g) remains
anomalous and is not readily explained by either historical or modern
(ecological) factors. For the African mammal fauna, a key question in
understanding the role of history versus ecology may not be why there
are so many large species, but why there are so few intermediate-sized
species.},

abstract = {The accuracy of methods for reconstructing parameters (e.g., tree density) of historical forest structure from General Land Office (GLO) survey data has not been thoroughly assessed. Past simulation and statistical assessments of plotless density estimators have focused on minimizing estimation error, but not congruent with the specific data available in the GLO surveys. Most GLO reconstruction studies do not reconstruct absolute measures of density, basal area, or diameter-class distributions, key measures used for forest restoration. We tested the accuracy of a suite of plotless density estimators and other survey methods to accurately reconstruct forest attributes using both a field-based modern calibration and a cross-validation with tree-ring reconstructions. In addition to the common distance estimators, we developed several Voronoi-based plotless density estimators that can be used with GLO data. Estimators were assessed using modern survey and plot data collected in the same location and spatial arrangement as the original survey locations in three geographically distinct areas. Results showed that Voronoi-based density estimators were superior to distance-based estimators. Data need to be pooled across locations. Voronoi estimators yielded more accurate measures of density and basal area and can be used at smaller pooling levels without sacrificing much accuracy. At spatial extents of 260 and 520 ha (3- and 6-corner pools), relative mean absolute error (RMAE) averaged 29% and 22%, respectively, for density estimates in all three study areas. To estimate basal area as accurately (i.e., 23%), data must be pooled to 780 ha (9-corner pool). Composition and diameter-class distributions also required larger pooling areas to achieve accurate results. In the cross-validation, accuracy of density and basal area were both superior to accuracy in the modern calibration, and RMAE for density and basal area at all pooling levels averaged 16.6% and 15.7%, respectively. Composition and diameter-class distribution estimates were lower in accuracy. Voronoi-based methods can accurately estimate historical forest parameters across large landscapes and are accurate at finer scales (e.g., 260 ha, 3-corner pool) than previously thought possible. GLO reconstructions complement tree-ring reconstructions but can provide more spatially comprehensive estimates of the historical range of forest variability, facilitating landscapelevel restoration.},

abstract = {Quantitative conservation objectives require detailed consideration of
the habitat requirements of target species. Tree-living bryophytes,
lichens, and fungi are a critical and declining biodiversity component
of boreal forests. To understand their requirements, Bayesian methods
were used to analyze the relationships between the occurrence of
individual species and habitat factors at the tree and the stand scale
in a naturally fragmented boreal forest landscape. The importance of
unexplained between-stand variation in occurrence of species was
estimated, and the ability of derived models to predict species'
occurrence was tested. The occurrence of species was affected by quality
of individual trees. Furthermore, the relationships between occurrence
of species at the tree level and size and shape of stands indicated edge
effects, implying that some species were restricted to interior habitats
of large, regular stands. Yet for the habitat factors studied,
requirements of many species appeared similar. Species occurrence also
varied between stands; most of the seemingly suitable trees in some
stands were unoccupied. The models captured most variation in species
occurrence at tree level. They also successfully accounted for
between-stand variation in species occurrence, thus providing realistic
simulations of stand-level occupancy of species. Important unexplained
between-stand variation in species occurrence warns against a simplified
view that only local habitat factors influence species' occurrence.
Apparently, similar stands will host populations of different sizes due
to historical, spatial, and stochastic factors. Thus, habitat
suitability cannot be assessed simply by population sizes, and stands
lacking a species may still provide suitable habitat and merit
protection.},

abstract = {A classification of spatial simulation models of fire and vegetation dynamics (landscape fire succession models or LFSMs) is presented. The classification was developed to provide a foundation for comparing models and to help identify the appropriate fire and vegetation processes and their simulation to include in coarse scale dynamic global vegetation models. Other uses include a decision tool for research and management applications and a vehicle to interpret differences between LFSMs. The classification is based on the four primary processes that influence fire and vegetation dynamics: fire ignition, fire spread, fire effects, and vegetation succession. Forty-four LFSMs that explicitly simulated the four processes were rated by the authors and the modelers on a scale from 0 to 10 for their inherent degree of stochasticity, complexity, and mechanism for each of the four processes. These ratings were then used to group LFSMs into similar classes using common ordination and clustering techniques. Another database was created to describe each LFSM using selected keywords for over 20 explanatory categories. This database and the ordination and clustering results were then used to create the final LFSM classification that contains 12 classes and a corresponding key. The database and analysis results were used to construct a second classification key so managers can pick the most appropriate model for their application based on computer resources, available modeling expertise, and management objective.

abstract = {Species distribution models are an important tool to predict the impact of global change on species distributional ranges and community assemblages. Although considerable progress has been made in the statistical modeling during the last decade, many approaches still ignore important features of species distributions, such as nonlinearity and interactions between predictors, spatial autocorrelation, and nonstationarity, or at most incorporate only some of these features. Ecologists, however, require a modeling framework that simultaneously addresses all these features flexibly and consistently. Here we describe such an approach that allows the estimation of the global effects of environmental variables in addition to local components dealing with spatiotemporal autocorrelation as well as nonstationary effects. The local components can be used to infer unknown spatiotemporal processes; the global component describes how the species is influenced by the environment and can be used for predictions, allowing the fitting of many well-known regression relationships, ranging from simple linear models to complex decision trees or from additive models to models inspired by machine learning procedures. The reliability of spatiotemporal predictions can be qualitatively predicted by separately evaluating the importance of local and global effects. We demonstrate the potential of the new approach by modeling the breeding distribution of the Red Kite (Milvus milvus), a bird of prey occurring predominantly in Western Europe, based on presence/absence data from two mapping campaigns using grids of 40 km 2 in Bavaria. The global component of the model selected seven environmental variables extracted from the CORINE and WorldClim databases to predict Red Kite breeding. The effect of altitude was found to be nonstationary in space, and in addition, the data were spatially autocorrelated, which suggests that a species distribution model that does not allow for spatially varying effects and spatial autocorrelation would have ignored important processes determining the distribution of Red Kite breeding across Bavaria. Thus, predictions from standard species distribution models that do not allow for real-world complexities may be considerably erroneous. Our analysis of Red Kite breeding exemplifies the potential of the innovative approach for species distribution models. The method is also applicable to modeling count data.},

abstract = {We assessed the effectiveness of different sampling strategies in
linking fine fuel load and crown scorch of ashe (Juniperus ashei) and
redberry juniper (J. pinchotii) for prescribed fires conducted in wet
and dry periods of the growing season on the Edwards Plateau, Texas,
USA. Our aim was to determine if spatial and temporal variation in
crown scorch was best predicted by estimates of fuel load sampled with
spatially explicit, multiscale sampling strategies or with traditional,
simple random sampling of fuel load. We found that multiscale sampling
of fuel load underneath and adjacent to juniper crowns was more
effective than simple random sampling in predicting crown scorch for
the 14 fires conducted in the wet period and the five conducted in the
dry period. The type of sampling strategy employed was critical in
relating fuel load to crown scorch during the wet period. Percent crown
volume scorched ranged from 0% to 100% in these conditions. In
contrast, the type of sampling strategy was less important in the dry
period when crown scorch was >90% for all juniper trees. We use these
findings to illustrate how a multiscale sampling design can increase
prediction power, thereby improving our ability to provide resource
professionals with critical values to target in management. Using Such
a strategy in this study revealed that fine fuel loading of 2670 kg .
ha(-1) were needed to scorch Juniper trees 100% for the conditions
present in the wet period, whereas only 1280 kg . ha(-1) were needed in
the dry period. To provide managers with this type of information, we
suggest that researchers shift from simple, random sampling of fuels to
alternate sampling designs where randomization is maintained in the
designation of treatments or selection of observations (i.e.,
individual juniper trees) but where fuel is systematically sampled at
the location of the observation of interest.},

abstract = {Fire regimes often vary at fine spatial scales in response to factors such as topography or fuels while climate usually synchronizes fires across broader scales. We investigated the relative influence of top-down and bottom-up controls on fire occurrence in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in a highly fragmented landscape at Mount Dellenbaugh, in northwestern Arizona. Our study area of 4,000 ha was characterized by patches of ponderosa pine forest in drainages that were separated by a matrix of pinyon–juniper woodlands, sagebrush shrublands, and perennial grasslands. We reconstructed fire histories from 135 fire-scarred trees in sixteen 25-ha sample sites placed in patches of mature ponderosa forest. We found that, among patches of ponderosa forest, fires were similar in terms of frequency but highly asynchronous in terms of individual years. Climate synchronized fire but only across broader spatial scales. Fires occurring at broader scales were associated with dry years that were preceded by several wet years. The remarkable level of asynchrony at finer scales suggests that bottom-up factors, such as site productivity and fuel continuity, were important in regulating fire at Mount Dellenbaugh. Understanding where bottom-up controls were historically influential is important for prioritizing areas that may best respond to fuel treatment under a warming climate},

abstract = {The success of eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris)
restoration programs in the Midwest has led to dramatic increases in
occupied range. Habitats with limited forest land, once thought
unsuitable for wild turkey, now support densities that exceed 30
birds/km(2) of timber. Turkey population growth has resulted in the
liberalization of harvest regulations with corresponding increases in
hunter numbers and turkey harvest. As pressures on the wild turkey
resource escalate, so does the need for an enhanced understanding of
population dynamics.
We used radiotelemetry to investigate survival and reproduction of wild
turkey hens from 1980 to 1989 in the mixed timber-agricultural region of
north-central Missouri. We also used direct recovery rates of banded
gobblers to examine spring harvest mortality. Radio-marked hens (n =
327) were monitored annually, greater than or equal to 5 times/week, to
derive estimates of cause-specific mortality, seasonal survival, and
reproductive parameters. Band numbers from tagged gobblers (n = 134)
were recorded at mandatory turkey check stations to estimate harvest
mortality.
Seasonal survival rates of hens were variable, with winter rates
exhibiting the greatest range (0.625-1.00). Although daily survival
rates did not differ among seasons (P = 0.142) according to analysis of
variance, a model selection procedure indicated that seasons could not
be combined. Cause-specific mortality varied among seasons within years,
with predation being the major cause of mortality. Legal fall-harvest
mortality averaged 4.4% of radio-marked hens. Illegal kill of hens
during the spring gobbler season ranged from 0.0 to 30.0% and averaged
5.2%, exceeding legal fall harvest of hens in some years. During the
first year after banding, 11.2% of adult gobblers were harvested during
spring hunting season.
The nesting rate (measured as the proportion of hens attempting to nest)
was consistent and high (greater than or equal to 0.9) across years;
however, hen success and nest success showed significant annual
variation. Hen success differed between adult and subadult hens as did
the success of first nests. We observed no difference in the success of
renests between age classes of hens. Most poult mortality occurred by
2-weeks posthatch; however, annual estimates varied among years. Poult
mortality at 4-weeks posthatch ranged from 0.419 to 0.705. Across years,
increasing poult mortality was associated (p = 0.75, P = 0.054) with the
number of days in June that rainfall exceeded 2.54 cm.
We used a stochastic population model to examine the effects of
simulated spring harvest on the age structure of males and the effects
of fall harvest on population growth. Increasing levels of spring
harvest resulted in a decreasing proportion of adult males in the spring
population and in the harvest. At a 5% level of fall harvest,
population size at year 40 increased in 72% of the simulations. When a
10% level of fall harvest was modeled, population size at year 40
decreased in all simulations. The model was sensitive to changes in hen
survival, nest success, and poult mortality. Simulations were run for 40
years with an initial population size of 5,820. Decreases in poult
mortality of 10 and 20% resulted in increases in average simulated
population size at year 40 of 3,154 and 19,957% (32.54 and 200.57
fold), respectively. The variation we observed in wild turkey survival
and reproduction and our population model outputs suggest that harvest
strategies can affect population growth and age structure. Fall harvests
have the greatest potential to affect population growth. We recommend
that state-level estimates of harvest, hunting pressure, reproduction,
and survival form the basis for developing and evaluating wild turkey
harvest strategies in the Midwest. A conservative approach to spring and
fall harvest regulations is recommended if sufficient data to model
populations are not available.},

abstract = {Quantitative metrics of horizontal and vertical structural attributes in eastside old-growth ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. and C. Lawson var. ponderosa) forests were measured to guide the design of restoration prescriptions. The age, size structure, and the spatial patterns were investigated in old-growth ponderosa pine forests at three protected study areas east of the crest of the Cascade Range: Metolius Research Natural Area and Pringle Butte Research Natural Area in central Oregon and Blacks Mountain Experimental Forest in northern California. The three study areas represented sites characterized by deep accumulations of pumice from Cascade volcanism. All stems 15 cm in height (minimum height of an established seedling) were mapped and measured on a total of 27 1-ha plots. The distribution of trees within each individual plot was investigated by second-order spatial analysis with Ripley's K(d) function, and then evaluated across each study area with functional data analysis. Coarse woody debris was sampled by using the strip-plot method to determine log density, mean log size, volume, and cover. The oldest trees were 618 years at Metolius, 613 years at Pringle Butte, and 330 years at Blacks Mountain. Stands were multi-aged, with as many as 16 cohorts at Metolius and 22 cohorts at Pringle Butte. Density of live old-growth ponderosa pine in the upper canopy ranged from 34 to 94 trees ha1 at Metolius, 35 to 79 trees ha1 at Pringle Butte, and 15 to 73 trees ha1 at Blacks Mountain; the differences between study areas were not significant, resulting in an overall mean density of 50  3.5 live old-growth trees ha1. Mean diameters of these oldgrowth trees did not differ among the three study areas; the overall mean was 60.0  1.55 cm dbh. Large dead ponderosa pines (overall mean diameter 61.7  4.33 cm) were a common feature at all three study areas; the overall mean density was 9.0  0.97 trees ha1. Ripley's K(d) analysis of spatial point patterns using upper canopy trees revealed significant departure from randomness in 24 of the 27 plots. Functional data analysis of the spatial relationship of all sample plots by study area revealed two strong patterns. At scales of 1.2  d  2.6 m at Metolius and 1.6  d  8.4 m at Blacks Mountain, the deviation from random was not significant, suggesting the distribution of old-growth trees was random. More important, significant positive deviation from complete spatial randomness at larger scales at Metolius and Blacks Mountain suggested a clumped distribution. Maximum radii of the clumps were about 22.5 m in diameter at Metolius and about 24 m in diameter at Blacks Mountain. In contrast, old-growth trees at Pringle Butte were randomly distributed. Density of logs at Metolius and Pringle Butte was 47.0  5.28 logs ha1, their mean large-end diameter was 37.6  2.41 cm, the mean length of each log was 4.2  0.09 m, the cumulative length of all logs averaged 512.9  78.12 m, the total volume averaged 62.3  6.30 m3 ha1, and the cover averaged 1.7  0.08%. A majority of the logs were in an advanced stage of decomposition, suggesting that they were in place for considerable time. These results are discussed in the context of reference conditions for restoration of ecosystem health and ecological integrity in eastside ponderosa pine forests.},

abstract = {Research in the Sierra Nevada range of California, USA, has provided conflicting results about current trends of high-severity fire. Previous studies have used only a portion of available fire severity data, or considered only a portion of the Sierra Nevada. Our goal was to investigate whether a trend in fire severity is occurring in Sierra Nevada conifer forests currently, using satellite imagery. We analysed all available fire severity data, 1984–2010, over the whole ecoregion and found no trend in proportion, area or patch size of high-severity fire. The rate of high-severity fire has been lower since 1984 than the estimated historical rate. Responses of fire behaviour to climate change and fire suppressionmay be more complex than assumed. A better understanding of spatiotemporal patterns in fire regimes is needed to predict future fire regimes and their biological effects. Mechanisms underlying the lack of an expected climate- and time since fire-related trend in high-severity fire need to be identified to help calibrate projections of future fire. The effects of climate change on high-severity fire extent may remain small compared with fire suppression. Management could shift from a focus on reducing extent or severity of fire in wildlands to protecting human communities from fire.},

During the pre-settlement period (1700/1750-1860), the Weibull median fire-free interval (WMFFI) and the mean firefree interval (MFFI) were 6.6-7 years at both sites. The MFFI during the settlement period (1860-1910) varied within 3 years of the pre-settlement value, but increased to 38 and 43 years for a truncated fire suppression period between 1910 and 1996. Increased variation in MFFI among aspect polygons suggests fire regimes have become more complex since Euro-settlement. In the pre-settlement period, an area equal to approximately 50-60% of the study areas burned every 6-7 years, an amount of fire disturbance apparently in balance with landscape and stand vegetation structure. Overlapping fires have created a complex mosaic of different fire histories on these forested landscapes. Mapped fire events from the 1700-1910 showed 134 and 157 separate fire history polygons (FHP) at the two sites.

abstract = {How simple can a model be that still captures essential aspects of wildfire ecosystems at large spatial and temporal scales? The Drossel-Schwabl model (DSM) is a metaphorical forest-fire model developed to reproduce only one pattern of real systems: a frequency distribution of fire sizes resembling a power law. Consequently, and because it appears oversimplified, it remains unclear what bearings the DSM has in reality. Here, we test whether the DSM is capable of reproducing a pattern that was not considered in its design, the hump-shaped relation between the diversity of succession stages and average annual area burnt. We found that the model, once reformulated to represent succession, produces realistic landscape diversity patterns. We investigated four succession scenarios of forest-fire ecosystems in the USA and Canada. In all scenarios, landscape diversity is highest at an intermediate average annual area burnt as predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. These results show that a model based solely on the dynamics of the fuel mosaic has surprisingly high predictive power with regard to observed statistical properties of wildfire systems at large spatial scales. Parsimonious models, such as the DSM can be used as starting points for systematic development of more structurally realistic but tractable wildfire models. Due to their simplicity they allow analytical approaches that further our understanding under increasing complexity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Aim Spatial autocorrelation in ecological data can inflate Type I errors in statistical analyses. There has also been a recent claim that spatial autocorrelation generates ‘red herrings', such that virtually all past analyses are flawed. We consider the origins of this phenomenon, the implications of spatial autocorrelation for macro-scale patterns of species diversity and set out a clarification of the statistical problems generated by its presence. Location To illustrate the issues involved, we analyse the species richness of the birds of western/central Europe, north Africa and the Middle East. Methods Spatial correlograms for richness and five environmental variables were generated using Moran's I coefficients. Multiple regression, using both ordinary least-squares (OLS) and generalized least squares (GLS) assuming a spatial structure in the residuals, were used to identify the strongest predictors of richness. Autocorrelation analyses of the residuals obtained after stepwise OLS regression were undertaken, and the ranks of variables in the full OLS and GLS models were compared. Results Bird richness is characterized by a quadratic north– south gradient. Spatial correlograms usually had positive autocorrelation up to c . 1600 km. Including the environmental variables successively in the OLS model reduced spatial autocorrelation in the residuals to non-detectable levels, indicating that the variables explained all spatial structure in the data. In principle, if residuals are not autocorrelated then OLS is a special case of GLS. However, our comparison between OLS and GLS models including all environmental variables revealed that GLS de-emphasized predictors with strong autocorrelation and long-distance clinal structures, giving more importance to variables acting at smaller geographical scales. Conclusion Although spatial autocorrelation should always be investigated, it does not necessarily generate bias. Rather, it can be a useful tool to investigate mechanisms operating on richness at different spatial scales. Claims that analyses that do not take into account spatial autocorrelation are flawed are without foundation.},

abstract = {Model validation is often realized as a test of how well model predictions match a set of independent observations. One would think that the burden of proof should rest with the model, to force it to show that it can make accurate predictions. Further, one would think that increasing the sample size ought to increase the model's ability to demonstrate its utility. Traditional statistical tools are inappropriate for this because they default to the case that the model and the data are no different, and their ability to detect differences increases with the sample size. These traditional tools are optimized to detect differences, rather than similarities. We present an alternative strategy for model validation that is based on regression and statistical tests of equivalence. Equivalence tests reverse the usual null hypothesis: they posit that the populations being compared are different and use the data to prove otherwise. In this sense, equivalence tests are lumping tests, whereas the traditional statistical tests are splitting tests. To date, model validation with equivalence tests has focused on comparisons of means. Our proposed test checks not only for similarity of means, but also for similarity between individual predictions and observations. The strategy is demonstrated using three case studies that differ in their modeling objectives, and for varied sample sizes. The proposed strategy provides a formal means of model validation that is superior to traditional statistical tests in each case.},

abstract = {The widespread attention that has been devoted to wildfires by the public, as well as by state and federal governments, over the last several years in the United States has created a demand for fuel reduction activities aimed at alleviating wildfire hazard. While the appropriateness of these fuel reduction activities has been discussed in detail in previous studies, only a few studies have experimentally examined the effects of fuel reduction on forests. This paper investigates the initial effects of three different fuel reduction strategies on forest structure and understory plant communities using replicated treatments, which are compared to untreated controls. Understory plants are grouped by plant growth form (shrub, forb, graminoid) and by plant origin (native, exotic). The effects of each treatment alternative: mechanical, prescribed fire, mechanical followed by prescribed fire, and untreated control, are reported for each plant group. Each fuel treatment modified forest structure such that growing space increased and allowed for rapid reestablishment of forbs and graminoids, which did not differ in abundance from pre-treatment levels. The mechanical only treatments (thinning from below and rotary mastication) significantly reduced shrub cover relative to the control, however mechanical plus fire and fire only treatments did not. Mechanical plus fire treatments altered forest structure most substantially, which may explain the observed increases in richness and cover of exotic species. However, the magnitude of these differences was small. Both treatments involving fire decreased native species richness significantly, but differences in native species cover were insignificant for any of the active treatments.

abstract = {Stand-level spatial pattern influences key aspects of resilience and ecosystem function such as disturbance behavior, regeneration, snow retention, and habitat quality in frequent-fire pine and mixed-conifer forests. Reference sites, from both pre-settlement era reconstructions and contemporary forests with active fire regimes, indicate that frequent-fire forests are complex mosaics of individual trees, tree clumps, and openings. There is a broad scientific consensus that restoration treatments should seek to restore this mosaic pattern in order to restore resilience and maintain ecosystem function. Yet, methods to explicitly incorporate spatial reference information into restoration treatments are not widely used. In addition, targets from reference conditions must be critically evaluated in light of climate change. We used a spatial clump identification algorithm to quantify reference patterns based on a specified intertree distance that defines when trees form clumps. We used climatic water balance parameters, downscaled climate projections, and plant associations to assess our historical reference sites in the context of projected future climate and identify climate analog reference conditions. Spatial reference information was incorporated into a novel approach to prescription development, tree marking, and monitoring based on viewing stand structure and pattern in terms of individuals, clumps, and openings (ICO) in a mixed-conifer forest restoration case study. We compared the results from the ICO approach with simulations of traditional basal area and spacing-based thinning prescriptions in terms of agreement with reference conditions and functional aspects of resilience. The ICO method resulted in a distribution of tree clumps and openings within the range of reference patterns, while the basal area and spacing approaches resulted in uniform patterns inconsistent with known reference conditions. Susceptibility to insect mortality was lower in basal area and spacing prescriptions, but openings and corresponding opportunities for regeneration and in situ climate adaptation were fewer. Operationally, the method struck a balance between providing clear targets for spatial pattern directly linked to reference conditions, sufficient flexibility to achieve other restoration objectives, and implementation efficiency. The need to track pattern targets during implementation and provide immediate feedback to marking crews was a key lesson. The ICO method, especially when used in combination with climate analog reference targets, offers a practical approach to restoring spatial patterns that are likely to enhance resilience and climate adaptation.},

abstract = {Organisms on the move face uncertainty regarding the state of their environments, and characterizing the magnitude of this uncertainty is important because of its influence on organismal decision making. Two common measures of the uncertainty inherent in a distribution of possible outcomes are variance and entropy, yet there is currently no standard for when one measure should be used over the other. This paper explores this question using two models of resource uncertainty. For small numbers of discrete possible outcomes, variance is the better measure because it captures the spread between outcomes as well as their differential possibilities. However, variance can categorically fail as a measure of uncertainty when distributions are multimodal or discontinuous, in which case entropy should be used to characterize uncertainty.},

The management problems are formulated for a mixed-conifer stand and approximations of the optimal solutions are obtained using simulation optimization. The Northern Idaho variant of the Forest Vegetation Simulator and its Fire and Fuels Extension is used to predict stand growth and fire effects. Interest rate and fire risk are found to be critical determinants of the superior stand management system and timber supply. Uneven-aged management is superior with higher interest rates with or without fire risk. Alterations in the interest rate affect optimal stocking levels of uneven-aged stands, but have only minor effects on the long-run timber supply. Higher interest rates reduce rotation length and regeneration investments of even-aged stands, which lead to markedly reduced timber supply. Increasing fire risk increases the relative efficiency of evenaged management because a single age cohort is less susceptible to fire damage over the course of the rotation than multiple cohorts in uneven-aged stands. Higher fire risk reduces optimal diameter limit under uneven-aged management and decreases optimal rotation length and planting density under even-aged management},

Here, we report the modeled effects of constructed defensible fuel profile zones and group selection treatments on crown fire potential, flame length, and conditional burn probabilities across 11 land allocation types for an 18 600 ha study area within the northern Sierra Nevada, California. Fire modeling was completed using FlamMap and FARSITE based on landscape files developed with high-resolution aerial (IKONOS) imagery, ground-based plot data, and integrated data from ARCFUELS and the Forest Vegetation Simulator. Under modeled 97th percentile weather conditions, average conditional burn probability was reduced between pre- and post-treatment landscapes. A more detailed simulation of a hypothetical fire burning under fairly severe fire weather, or "problem fire", revealed a 39% reduction in final fire size for the treated landscape relative to the pre-treatment condition. To modify fire behavior at a landscape level, a combination of fuel treatment strategies that address topographic location, land use allocations, vegetation types, and lire regimes is needed.},

abstract = {Over the last century, northeast Pacific coastal sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and land-based surface air temperatures (SATs) display multidecadal variations associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, in addition to a warming trend of ∼0.5–1 °C. Using independent records of sea-level pressure (SLP), SST, and SAT, this study investigates northeast (NE) Pacific coupled atmosphere–ocean variability from 1900 to 2012, with emphasis on the coastal areas around North America. We use a linear stochastic time series model to show that the SST evolution around the NE Pacific coast can be explained by a combination of regional atmospheric forcing and ocean persistence, accounting for 63% of nonseasonal monthly SST variance (r = 0.79) and 73% of variance in annual means (r = 0.86). We show that SLP reductions and related atmospheric forcing led to century-long warming around the NE Pacific margins, with the strongest trends observed from 1910–1920 to 1940. NE Pacific circulation changes are estimated to account for more than 80% of the 1900–2012 linear warming in coastal NE Pacific SST and US Pacific northwest (Washington, Oregon, and northern California) SAT. An ensemble of climate model simulations run under the same historical radiative forcings fails to reproduce the observed regional circulation trends. These results suggest that natural internally generated changes in atmospheric circulationwere the primary cause of coastal NE Pacific warming from 1900 to 2012 and demonstrate more generally that regional mechanisms of interannual and multidecadal temperature variability can also extend to century time scales.},

The technique used reduces the seven curves for each treatment for each variable of interest to a single set of readily interpretable mean curves. To a top height of 100 ft and corresponding average age of 45 years, volume growth and yield are strongly related to stocking level, being highest at the highest stocking levels. At that point, current annual increment is still far greater than mean annual increment. Thinning has accelerated diameter growth of the largest 40 trees per acre as well as of the stand average. Maximum volume production would be obtained at stand relative densities approaching the zone of competition-related mortality, although in practice considerations of feasibility of frequent entries and wildlife and amenity considerations would make somewhat lower average levels necessary},

abstract = {Ecological data frequently containmultiple patterns. A process model of the system producing the data should be able to recreate those patterns.We describe amethod and associated software where components of the pattern are used as multiple criteria to assess a model during its construction. Successive improvements aremade to the model so that it describes more components of the pattern effectively. The software, Pareto Evolve is an evolutionary algorithm. Initially it creates many individual sets of model parameters, each is used in the model to produce results that are then compared to patterns in a data set. Different individuals may achieve different components of the pattern and Pareto Evolve calculates those that are most effective and uses them to produce new individuals. This is done by changing parameter values of individuals, called mutation, or exchanging parameter values between individuals, called crossover. This process is repeated over many generations so that a most effective parameterization evolves. We illustrate this method with a model for hourly increments of extension of the leading shoot of a conifer tree. The particular task here is to model water uptake by the plant in response to water loss due to transpiration, calculate a water deficit between uptake and loss, and calculate contraction and re-expansion of shoot tissue due to diurnal changes in tissue water deficit. We choose criteria corresponding to different phases in the diurnal pattern of expansion and model for up to six consecutive days. A value is set marking the limit within which the model must achieve the criteria for it to be judged as success. This value is called a binary discrepancy measure. Pareto Evolve is used to make multiple searches with successively smaller binary discrepancy measures until all criteria are no longer achieved. At this point different parameter sets achieve different groups of criteria and we use these as indicators of how the structure of the model must be improved to achieve an overall better fit. In our example we find that contraction is more rapid than re-expansion, which is a hysteresis effect, and that reexpansion of tissue continues after water deficit within the tissue is estimated to have been removed. We discuss how this method can be used in model development and particularly how multiple criteria assessment can be used in model development.},

Using 185 sites from the International Tree-Ring data bank, each of which contained 10-60 raw ring-width series, we rebuilt two chronologies for each site, and using two conservative methods designed to retain any low-frequency patterns in site chronologies and estimated the slope of the growth trend since 1850 at each site from a combination of linear regression and time-series techniques. This slope was the response variable in a regression-tree model to predict the effects of environmental gradients and species-level differences on growth trends. Growth patterns at 27 sites from the American Southwest were consistent with quasi-periodic patterns of drought. Either 12 or 32 of the 185 sites demonstrated patterns of increasing growth between 1850 and 1980 A.D., depending on the standardization technique used. Pronounced growth increases were associated with high elevation sites (above 3000 m) and high-latitude sites in maritime climates. Future research focused on these high-elevation and high-latitude sites should address the precise mechanisms responsible for increased 20th century growth.},

In the present paper, the variance of the sample covariance is computed for a finite number of locations, under the multinormality assumption, and the mathematical derivation of the definition of effective sample size is given. The theoretically expected number of degrees of freedom for the modified t test with renewed modifications is compared with that computed on the basis of equation (2.9) of Clifford et al. (1989).

The common methods for estimating the height-diameter models have taken the classical (frequentist) approach based on the frequency interpretation of probability, for example, the nonlinear least squares method (NLS) and the maximum likelihood method (ML). The Bayesian method has an exclusive advantage compared with classical method that the parameters to be estimated are regarded as random variables. In this study, the classical and Bayesian methods were used to estimate six height-diameter models, respectively. Both the classical method and Bayesian method showed that the Weibull model was the "best" model using data1. In addition, based on the Weibull model, data2 was used for comparing Bayesian method with informative priors with uninformative priors and classical method. The results showed that the improvement in prediction accuracy with Bayesian method led to narrower confidence bands of predicted value in comparison to that for the classical method, and the credible bands of parameters with informative priors were also narrower than uninformative priors and classical method. The estimated posterior distributions for parameters can be set as new priors in estimating the parameters using data2.},

abstract = {Bats typically roost head-under-heels but they cannot hover in this
position, thus, landing on a ceiling presents a biomechanical challenge.
To land, a bat must perform an acrobatic flip that brings the claws of
the toes in contact with the ceiling and do so gently enough as to avoid
injury to its slender hindlimbs. In the present study, we sought to
determine how bats land, to seek a link between landing kinematics and
ceiling impact forces, and to determine whether landing strategies vary
among bat species. To do this, we measured the kinematics and kinetics
of landing behaviour in three species of bats as they landed on a
force-measuring platform (Cynopterus brachyotis, N=3; Carollia
perspicillata, N=5; Glossophaga soricina, N=5). Kinematics were similar
for all bats within a species but differed among species. C. brachyotis
performed four-point landings, during which body pitch increased until
the ventral surface of the body faced the ceiling and the thumbs and
hindlimbs simultaneously grasped the surface. Bats of the other two
species performed two-point landings, whereby only the hindlimbs made
contact with the ceiling. During these two-point landings, the hindlimbs
were drawn up the side of the body to come in contact with the ceiling,
causing simultaneous changes in body pitch, roll and yaw over the course
of the landing sequence. Right-handed and left-handed forms of the
two-point landing were observed, with individuals often switching back
and forth between them among landing events. The four-point landing of
C. brachyotis resulted in larger peak forces (3.7 +/- 2.4 body weights;
median +/- interquartile range) than the two-point landings of C.
perspicillata (0.8 +/- 0.6 body weights) or G. soricina (0.8 +/- 0.2
body weights). Our results demonstrate that the kinematics and kinetics
of landing vary among bat species and that there is a correlation
between the way a bat moves its body when it lands and the magnitude of
peak impact force it experiences during that landing. We postulate that
these interspecific differences in impact force could result because of
stronger selective pressure for gentle landing in cave-roosting (C.
perspicillata, G. soricina) versus foliage-roosting (C. brachyotis)
species.},

abstract = {Recent literature shows a lively debate on how to capture ecological and environmental aspects in different evaluation methods and the closely related issue of the (im)possibilities ofmonetization of these aspects. Although economists in general tend to favour Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) above Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA), part of the literature suggests that CBA falls short of being the only decision-making device for environmental problems, both for theoretical and practical reasons. This paper discusses both evaluation methods and the main results of a major, publicly-financed nature conservation project in The Netherlands. The evaluation method combines the straightforwardness of CBA with the flexibility of MCA. Conceptually, it consists of a MCA, the net result of a CBA being integrated as one of the criteria. The different aspects of the nature conservation project that can be monetized are incorporated into the CBA. Other aspects such as changes in biodiversity or scenic beauty are analysed in their own dimension, provided (cardinal) quantification is possible. In fact, the analysis consists of a very simple MCA, with two criteria: social costs and a quantitative measure of nature. Quantifying the amount of nature in its own, non-monetary dimension is a key element of the empirical analysis. A detailed quantitative estimate is made of the improvement of nature, based upon 564 species and 131 different ecosystems. The result of the evaluation is a trade-off at the national level between ecological improvements (plus 18 percent) and social costs (DFl. 3.4 billion net present value). Due to the detailed quantification of the effect on nature the evaluation also yields results about the cost-effectiveness of four different instruments to create and to preserve nature. That part of the analysis shows that complete withdrawal of agricultural land for nature purposes in the project in general is more cost-effective than subsidizing nature-friendly farming, although the former is more expensive.},

abstract = {Forest managers in the Pacific Northwest are faced with new challenges of providing for all wildlife in managed forests. Our objective was to elucidate the factors governing the composition and biomass of forest floor mammal communities that are ame- nable to management. We sampled small mammal communities in forests of various man- agement histories on the Olympic Peninsula and contrasted our results with those of other large studies in the Pacific Northwest. Forest floor mammal communities in forests >35 yr old in the Western Hemlock Zone of Washington and Oregon are composed of 5-8 characteristic species. These include Sorex trowbridgii (numerically the most dominant); one species each of Clethrionomys, the Sorex vagrans complex, and Peromyscus; and Neurotrichus gibbsii. Species composition changes from south to north, and the communities on the Olympic Peninsula contain two or three additional species compared to communities to the south. Communities in naturally re- generated and clearcutting regenerated (managed) young forests are similar in composition to those in old growth; old growth, however, supports 1.5 times more individuals and biomass than managed forest. Community diversity seems related to the south-north mois- ture-temperature gradient that is reflected in increased diversity of canopy conifers, de- velopment of forest floor litter layers, accumulation of coarse woody debris, and abundance of herbs, deciduous shrubs, and shade-tolerant seedlings (as opposed to understories dom- inated by evergreen shrubs). Previous work found few habitat variables that were good predictors of species abundance in natural young and old-growth stands.

Fuel treatments reduce on-site carbon and also change the fire potential and expected outcome of future wildfires, including their carbon emissions. We simulated effects of fuel treatments on 140 stands representing seven major habitat type groups of the northern Rocky Mountains using the Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FFE-FVS). Changes in forest carbon due tomechanical fuel treatment (thinning from below to reduce ladder fuels) and prescribed fire were explored, as well as changes in expected fire behavior and effects of subsequent wildfire. Results indicated that fuel treatments decreased fire severity and crown fire occurrence and reduced subsequent wildfire emissions, but did not increase post-wildfire carbon stored on-site. Conversely, untreated stands had greater wildfire emissions but stored more carbon},

The proposed formulation is tested on the Spanish juniper (Juniperus thurifera L.), using data from 883 permanent and temporary plots throughout its distribution area in the Spanish autonomous region of Castilla y Leo´n. The suitability of the territory for the species is assessed by previously studying its habitat, which in turn is analyzed through physiographic and climatic parameters. This new method is rooted in an additive index that depends on the Mahalanobis distance in the parametric space that evaluates the ecological resemblance between the studied site and each of the points defining the parametric habitat. Thereby the ecological potential of any site within the territory can be established, integrated in a geographical information systems and accordingly charted. The results are compared with those obtained with the methodology traditionally used by Spanish foresters (factorial index), showing that the overall potential area is similar in size but quite different in its distribution.},

abstract = {Understanding disturbance and recovery of forest landscapes is a
challenge because of complex interactions over a range of temporal and
spatial scales. Landscape simulation models offer an approach to
studying such systems at broad scales. Fire can be simulated spatially
using mechanistic or stochastic approaches. We describe the fire module
in a spatially explicit, stochastic model of forest landscape dynamics
(LANDIS) that incorporates fire, windthrow, and harvest disturbance with
species-level succession. A stochastic approach is suited to forest
landscape models that are designed to simulate patterns over large
spatial and time domains and are not used deterministically to predict
individual events.
We used the model to examine how disturbance regimes and species
dynamics interact across a large (500 000 ha), heterogeneous landscape
in northern Wisconsin, USA, with six land types having different species
environments, and fire disturbance return intervals varying from 200 to
1000 yr. The model shows that there are feedbacks over time between
species, disturbance, and environment, resulting in the re-emergence of
patterns that characterized the landscape before extensive alteration.
Landscape equilibrium of species com position and age-class structure
develops at three scales from the initial, disturbed landscape. Over
100-150 yr, fine-grained successional processes cause gradual
disaggregation of the initial pattern of relatively homogenous
composition and age classes. Species such as eastern hemlock (Tsuga
canadensis), largely removed from the landscape by past human
activities. only slowly re-invade. Next, patterns on the various land
types diverge, driven by different disturbance regimes and dominant
species. Finally, aging of the landscape causes the probabilities of
larger and more severe fires to increase, and a coarse-grained pattern
develops from the disturbance patches. Influence of adjacent land types
is shown as fires spread across land type boundaries, although modified
in spread and severity. As found by others, altered landscapes are
likely to retain their modified pattern for centuries, suggesting that
nonequilibrium conditions between tree species and climate will persist
under predicted rates of climate change.
The results suggest that this modeling approach can be useful in
examining species level, broad-scale responses of heterogeneous
landscapes to changes in landscape disturbance, such as modified
management or land-use scenarios, or effects of global change.},

abstract = {Ecosystem models have been developed for assessment and management in a wide variety of environments. As model complexity increases, it becomes more difficult to trace how imperfect knowledge of internal model parameters, data inputs, or relationships among parameters might impact model results, affecting predictions and subsequent management decisions. Sensitivity analysis is an essential component of model evaluation, particularly when models are used to make management decisions. Results should be expressed as probabilities and should realistically account for uncertainty. When models are particularly complex, this can be difficult to do and to present in ways that do not obfuscate essential results. We conducted a sensitivity analysis of the Ecosystem Diagnosis and Treatment (EDT) model, which predicts salmon productivity and capacity as a function of ecosystem conditions. We used a novel "structured sensitivity analysis" approach that is particularly useful for very complex models or those with an abundance of interconnected parameters. We identified small, medium, and large plausible ranges for both input data and model parameters. Using a Monte Carlo approach, we explored the variation in output, prediction intervals, and sensitivity indices, given these plausible input distributions. The analyses indicated that, as a consequence of internal parameter uncertainty, EDT productivity and capacity predictions lack the precision needed for many management applications. However, EDT prioritization of reaches for preservation or restoration was more robust to given input uncertainties, indicating that EDT may be more useful as a relative measure of fish performance than as an absolute measure. Like all large models, if EDT output is to be used as input to other models or management tools it is important to explicitly incorporate the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses into such secondary analyses. Sensitivity analyses should become standard operating procedure for evaluation of ecosystem models.},

Since the ecological role of fire in the regeneration and perpetuation of these pines is well known, it makes sense to use fire to maintain pine ecosystems through forest management that uses an understory prescribed burn program. Fears of fire escape and a poor knowledge of applying fire correctly to these ecosystems are the result of poor training in the use of prescribed fire, which normally concentrates solely on post-harvest slash sites; this has prevented extensive use of understory prescribed burning in the past. However, research in Canada, principally using the Canadian Forest Fire Behavior Prediction (FBP) System coupled with the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System, allows forest managers to develop burning prescriptions that are safe and economical while meeting objectives for seedbed preparation, natural seeding and control of competing vegetation.},

abstract = {Forests characterized by mixed-severity fires occupy a broad moisture gradient between lower elevation forests typified by low-severity fires and higher elevation forests in which high-severity, stand replacing fires are the norm. Mixed-severity forest types are poorly documented and little understood but likely occupy significant areas in the western United States. By definition, mixed-severity types have high beta diversity at meso-scales, encompassing patches of both high and low severity and gradients in between. Studies of mixed-severity types reveal complex landscapes in which patch sizes follow a power law distribution with many small and few large patches. Forest types characterized by mixed severity can be classified according to the modal proportion of high to low severity patches, which increases from relatively dry to relatively mesic site conditions. Mixed-severity regimes are produced by interactions between top-down forcing by climate and bottom-up shaping by topography and the flammability of vegetation, although specific effects may vary widely across the region, especially the relation between aspect and fire severity. History is important in shaping fire behavior in mixed-severity landscapes, as patterns laid down by previous fires can play a significant role in shaping future fires. Like low-severity forests in the western United States, many dry mixed-severity types experienced significant increases in stand density during the 20th century, threatening forest health and biodiversity, however not all understory development in mixed-severity forests increases the threat of severe wild fires. In general, current landscapes have been homogenized, reducing beta diversity and increasing the probability of large fires and insect outbreaks. Further loss of old, fire tolerant trees is of particular concern, but understory diversity has been reduced as well. High stand densities on relatively dry sites increase water use and therefore susceptibility to drought and insect outbreaks, exacerbating a trend of increasing regional drying. The need to restore beta diversity while protecting habitat for closed-forest specialists such as the northern spotted owl call for landscape-level approaches to ecological restoration. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Modelling techniques used in binary classification problems often result in a predicted probability surface, which is then translated into a presence–absence classification map. However, this translation requires a (possibly subjective) choice of threshold above which the variable of interest is predicted to be present. The selection of this threshold value can have dramatic effects on model accuracy as well as the predicted prevalence for the variable (the overall proportion of locations where the variable is predicted to be present). The traditional default is to simply use a threshold of 0.5 as the cut-off, but this does not necessarily preserve the observed prevalence or result in the highest prediction accuracy, especially for data sets with very high or very low observed prevalence. Alternatively, the thresholds can be chosen to optimize map accuracy, as judged by various criteria. Here we examine the effect of 11 of these potential criteria on predicted prevalence, prediction accuracy, and the resulting map output. Comparisons are made using output from presence–absence models developed for 13 tree species in the northern mountains of Utah. We found that species with poor model quality or low prevalence were most sensitive to the choice of threshold. For these species, a 0.5 cut-off was unreliable, sometimes resulting in substantially lower kappa and underestimated prevalence, with possible detrimental effects on amanagement decision. If a management objective requires a map to portray unbiased estimates of species prevalence, then the best results were obtained from thresholds deliberately chosen so that the predicted prevalence equaled the observed prevalence, followed closely by thresholds chosen to maximize kappa. These were also the two criteria with the highest mean kappa from our independent test data. For particular management applications the special cases of user specified required accuracymay be most appropriate. Ultimately, maps will typically have multiple and somewhat conflicting management applications. Therefore, providing users with a continuous probability surface may be the most versatile and powerful method, allowing threshold choice to be matched with each maps intended use.},

These models typically evaluate bird behaviour by focusing on a single optimization currency, such as total migration time or energy-use, without explicitly considering trade-offs between the involved objectives. In this paper, we demonstrate that this classic single-objective approach downplays the importance of variability in bird behaviour. In the light of these considerations, we therefore propose to use a full multi-criteria optimization method to isolate the set of non-dominated, efficient or Pareto optimal solutions. Unlike single-objective optimization where there is only one combination of bird behaviour maximizing fitness, the Pareto solution set represents a range of optimal solutions to conflicting objectives. Our results demonstrate that this multiobjective approach provides important new ways of analyzing how environmental factors and behavioural constraints have driven the evolution of migratory behaviour.},

abstract = {This state-of-knowledge review examines some of the underlying assumptions and limitations associated with the inter-relationships among four widely used descriptors of surface fire behaviour and post-fire impacts in wildland fire science and management, namely Byram's fireline intensity, flame length, stem-bark char height and crown scorch height. More specifically, the following topical areas are critically examined based on a comprehensive review of the pertinent literature: (i) estimating fireline intensity from flame length; (ii) substituting flame length for fireline intensity in Van Wagner's crown fire initiation model; (iii) the validity of linkages between the Rothermel surface fire behaviour and Van Wagner's crown scorch height models; (iv) estimating flame height from post-fire observations of stem-bark char height; and (v) estimating fireline intensity from post-fire observations of crown scorch height. There has been an overwhelming tendency within the wildland fire community to regard Byram's flame lengthfireline intensity and Van Wagner's crown scorch heightfireline intensity models as universal in nature. However, research has subsequently shown that such linkages among fire behaviour and post-fire impact characteristics are in fact strongly influenced by fuelbed structure, thereby necessitating consideration of fuel complex specific-type models of such relationships. {\textcopyright} 2012 IAWF.},

abstract = {There is widespread concern that fire exclusion has led to an unprecedented threat of uncharacteristically severe fires in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex. Laws) and mixed-conifer forests of western North America. These extensive montane forests are considered to be adapted to a low/moderate-severity fire regime that maintained stands of relatively old trees. However, there is increasing recognition from landscape-scale assessments that, prior to any significant effects of fire exclusion, fires and forest structure were more variable in these forests. Biota in these forests are also dependent on the resources made available by higher-severity fire. A better understanding of historical fire regimes in the ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests of western North America is therefore needed to define reference conditions and help maintain characteristic ecological diversity of these systems. We compiled landscape-scale evidence of historical fire severity patterns in the ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests from published literature sources and stand ages available from the Forest Inventory and Analysis program in the USA. The consensus from this evidence is that the traditional reference conditions of low-severity fire regimes are inaccurate for most forests of western North America. Instead, most forests appear to have been characterized by mixed-severity fire that included ecologically significant amounts of weather-driven, high-severity fire. Diverse forests in different stages of succession, with a high proportion in relatively young stages, occurred prior to fire exclusion. Over the past century, successional diversity created by fire decreased. Our findings suggest that ecological management goals that incorporate successional diversity created by fire may support characteristic biodiversity, whereas current attempts to "restore" forests to open, low-severity fire conditions may not align with historical reference conditions in most ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests of western North America.},

abstract = {We present a spatially explicit Landscape Fire-Succession Model (LFSM)
developed to represent Mediterranean Basin landscapes and capable of
integrating modules and functions that explicitly represent human
activity. Plant-functional types are used to represent spatial and
temporal competition for resources (water and light) in a rule-based
modelling framework. Vegetation dynamics are represented using a
rule-based community-level modelling approach that considers multiple
succession pathways and vegetation climax states. Wildfire behaviour is
represented using a cellular-automata model of fire spread that
accounts for land-cover flammability, slope, wind and vegetation
moisture. Results show that wildfire spread parameters have the
greatest influence on two aspects of the model: land-cover change and
the wildfire regime. This sensitivity highlights the importance of
accurately parameterising this type of grid-based model for
representing landscape-level processes. We use a pattern-oriented
modelling approach in conjunction with wildfire power-law
frequency-area scaling exponent beta to calibrate the model. Parameters
describing the role of soil Moisture on vegetation dynamics are also
found to significantly influence land-cover change. Recent improvements
in understanding the role of soil moisture and wildfire fuel loads at
the landscape-level will drive advances in Mediterranean LFSMs. (C)

abstract = {A critical requirement in the ecological management of fire is
knowledge of the age-class distribution of the vegetation. Such
knowledge is important because it underpins the distribution of
ecological features important to plants and animals including retreat
sites, food sources and foraging microhabitats. However, in many
regions, knowledge of the age-class distribution of vegetation is
severely constrained by the limited data available on fire history.
Much fire-history mapping is restricted to post-1972 fires, following
satellite imagery becoming widely available. To investigate fire
history in the semi-arid Murray Mallee region in southern Australia, we
developed regression models for six species of mallee eucalypt
(Eucalyptus oleosa F. Muell. ex. Miq. subsp. oleosa, E. leptophylla F.
Muell. ex. Miq., E. dumosa J. Oxley, E. costata subsp. murrayana L. A.
S. Johnson & K. D. Hill, E. gracilis F. Muell. and E. socialis F.
Muell. ex. Miq.) to quantify the relationship between mean stem
diameter and stem age (indicated by fire-year) at sites of known time
since fire. We then used these models to predict mean stem age, and
thus infer fire-year, for sites where the time since fire was not
known. Validation of the models with independent data revealed a highly
significant correlation between the actual and predicted time since
fire (r = 0.71, P < 0.001, n = 88), confirming the utility of this
method for ageing stands of mallee eucalypt vegetation. Validation data
suggest the models provide a conservative estimate of the age of a site
(i.e. they may under-estimate the minimum age of sites >35 years since
fire). Nevertheless, this approach enables examination of post-fire
chronosequences in semi-arid mallee ecosystems to be extended from 35
years post-fire to over 100 years. The predicted ages identified for
mallee stands imply a need for redefining what is meant by `old-growth'
mallee, and challenges current perceptions of an over-abundance of
`long-unburnt' mallee vegetation. Given the strong influence of fire on
semi-arid mallee vegetation, this approach offers the potential for a
better understanding of long-term successional dynamics and the status
of biota in an ecosystem that encompasses more than 250 000 km(2) of
southern Australia.},

abstract = {Reserve designers typically strive to create reserves that satisfy a variety of potentially conflicting criteria. Rather than optimizing with respect to just one criterion, reserve planners are likely to seek some compromise. To facilitate bioreserve design, I propose the use of multiobjective programming to identify these compromise alternatives, and then the use of the simple multiattribute rating technique to rank these alternatives and to explore the sensitivity of the rankings to the relative value placed on the individual criteria. An example is provided for the selection of a reserve system in Nova Scotia, Canada, based on three criteria: (1) connectedness, (2) area, and (3) rare species representation. First, multiobjective programming was used to reduce the set of over 15 000 potential reserve-system alternatives to a list of 36 candidate systems representing the optimal tradeoffs among the three criteria. The simple attribute-rating technique was then used to identify a single best solution for an arbitrary set of relative criteria values and to test the robustness of this solution to changes in relative preferences for the criteria. The techniques presented here can simplify the evaluation of reserve alternatives, enabling planners to refocus their efforts on the complex biological, social, and economic aspects of reserve design.},

abstract = {The island of Minorca, Spain, has become a patchy mosaic landscape as a result of centuries of human-induced fragmentation. The dynamics of the landscape elements and the spatial pattern of Minorca were analysed to test whether this human-modelled landscape was at a stationary state, and, if it was the case, to see whether the system could be characterized by a particular spatial pattern. Landsat TM satellite images were processed to derive land cover classification and vegetation index maps corresponding to the years 1984 and 1992, the best compromise between een null cloudiness and maximum time span. The classification was used to test the stationary state by estimating the transition matrix; of land cover. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to analyse the spatial pattern of change at the patch level. The spatial analysis of NDVI was based on four indices: fractal dimension, number and size distribution of patches, and spatial Kappa index. Those pattern descriptors were compared with values obtained from stochastic landscape simulations. Temporal analysis showed that land cover proportions remained approximately constant over the 8-year period, although interchange amongst patches existed. This suggested that the landscape of Minorca was close to a stationary state. The study of NDVI changes revealed that the spatial structure was different from that of neutral models and presented scale invariance properties. Results from land cover transitions and from NDVI patterning suggest that the landscape of Minorca is a critical system, in the framework of the self-organized criticality hypothesis, i.e. the mosaic of patches would self-organize at the frontier of a dynamic equilibrium constituted by the balance between disturbances and successional processes.},

Our objective is to develop tools that help model users estimate the precision of FVS projections. A technique called bootstrap resampling (bootstrapping) allows us to approximate the sampling distribution of any variable simulated by FVS. To use the technique, the original FVS tree list is sampled repeatedly, with replacement, to build hundreds of bootstrapped tree lists. These bootstrapped tree lists are then used to make several hundred FVS projections. Each projection is thus based on a resample of the original tree list. The resulting empirical distribution provides information on the sampling uncertainty associated with the original tree list, which is important for making statistical inferences about FVS model outcome. This paper introduces a new bootstrapping program (FVSBoot) and describes its purpose and potential value.},

abstract = {Fuel treatments in fire- suppressed mixed- conifer forests are designed to moderate potential wildfire behavior and effects. However, the objectives for modifying potential fire effects can vary widely, from improving fire suppression efforts and protecting infrastructure, to reintroducing low- severity fire, to restoring and maintaining variable forest structure and wildlife habitat. In designing a fuel treatment, managers can alter the treatment's prescription, placement, and extent (collectively the “treatment strat- egy”) to optimally meet one objective. However, the potential for trade- offs among different objectives is rarely tested systematically in fire- prone landscapes. To evaluate trade- offs in mechanical fuel treatment objectives related to fire severity, smoke production, forest heterogeneity, and avian wildlife habitat, we used a cross- platform modeling approach based on spatially explicit modifications of forest structure data for a 7820- ha landscape in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California. We examine whether (1) a more uniform treat- ment strategy aimed at fire hazard reduction (FHR) had negative effects on wildlife diversity, (2) a strategy focused on protecting the wildland–urban interface (WUI) left other portions of the landscape vulnerable to high- severity fire, and (3) increasing the extent of fuel treatments across the landscape led to greater reductions in fire severity and smoke emissions. When approximately 13% of the landscape was treated, the proportion of the landscape vulnerable to high- severity fire decreased by 13–44%, with the more uni- form FHR strategy leading to greater reductions. Slight increases in predicted avian species richness that followed all treatment strategies were not closely linked to increases in canopy variability. The WUI protection strategy led to considerable reductions in fire severity at the landscape scale. Increasing the extent of treatments to 30% of the landscape did little to further reduce the area vulnerable to high- severity fire, with additional reductions of 4–7% depending on the prescription. However, increasing the extent of treat- ments reduced the extent of harmful downwind smoke impacts, primarily by reducing rate of fire spread. Treatment strategies will depend on specific management objectives, but we illustrate that trade- offs are not necessarily inherent in general outcomes of fuel treatments.},

abstract = {Landscape simulation models are widely used to study the behavior of ecological systems. As computing power has increased, these models have become more complex and incorporated more realistic spatial representations of landscape patterns and ecological processes. The goal of this research was to examine the sensitivity of simulated landscape patterns to fundamental spatial modeling assumptions. The LANDIS simulator was parameterized for forests of the Georgia Piedmont and used to model landscape-scale community dynamics at fire return intervals from 20 to 100 years. A base scenario incorporating localized seed dispersal along with landform-related variation in species establishment rates and disturbance regimes was contrasted with three alternative scenarios. The uniform habitat scenario applied the same set of species establishment coefficients across all landforms. The uniform dispersal scenario removed the effects of seed source abundance and pattern on species establishment. The uniform disturbance scenario assumed identical disturbance regimes on all landforms. At the shortest fire return intervals, fire severities were low and the stand age distribution was dominated by older forests. At longer fire return intervals, fire severities were high and the stand age distribution was skewed toward younger forests. Species composition generally followed a gradient from fire-resistant species at short fire return intervals to fire-sensitive species at longer fire return intervals. However, some species exhibited bimodal distributions with high abundances at both short and long fire return intervals. Landscape responses to fire were similar in the uniform habitat scenario and the base scenario. Communities were less sensitive to fire return interval and had more fire-sensitive species in the uniform dispersal scenario than in the base scenario. Species composition in the uniform disturbance scenario was similar to the base scenario for the longest fire-intervals, but was more sensitive to changes in the fire regime at shorter fire return intervals. In models of Piedmont forest landscapes, accurate spatial representations of dispersal and fire regime heterogeneity are essential for predicting landscape-scale species composition under changing fire regimes. In contrast, the precise spatial representation of species–habitat relationships may be considerably less important.},

In this study, we used a large dataset of Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) surface fuel estimates (n=13,138) to create a new fuel classification called Fuel Type Groups (FTGs) from FIA forest type groups, and then keyed an FLM, FCCS, and FTG class to each FIA plot based on fuel loadings and stand conditions. We then compared FIA sampled loadings to the keyed class loading values for four surface fuel components (duff, litter, fine woody debris, coarse woody debris) and to mapped FLM, FCCS, and FTG class loading values from spatial fuel products. We found poor performances (R2<0.30) for most fuel component loadings in all three classifications that, in turn, contributed to poor mapping accuracies. The main reason for the poor performances is the high variability of the four fuel component loadings within classification categories and the inherent scale of this variability does not seem to match the FIA measurement scale or LANDFIRE mapping scale. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Under a rapidly warming climate, a critical management issue in semiarid forests of western North America is how to increase forest resilience to wildfire. We evaluated relationships between fuel reduction treatments and burn severity in the 2006 Tripod Complex fires, which burned over 70,000 ha of mixed-conifer forests in the North Cascades range of Washington State and involved 387 past harvest and fuel treatment units. A secondary objective was to investigate other drivers of burn severity including landform, weather, vegetation characteristics, and a recent mountain pine beetle outbreak. We used sequential autoregression (SAR) to evaluate drivers of burn severity, represented by the relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio index, in two study areas that are centered on early progressions of the wildfire complex. Significant predictor variables include treatment type, landform (elevation), fire weather (minimum relative humidity and maximum temperature), and vegetation characteristics, including canopy closure, cover type, and mountain pine beetle attack. Recent mountain pine beetle damage was a statistically significant predictor variable with red and mixed classes of beetle attack associated with higher burn severity. Treatment age and size were only weakly correlated with burn severity and may be partly explained by the lack of treatments older than 30 years and the low rates of fuel succession in these semiarid forests. Even during extreme weather, fuel conditions and landform strongly influenced patterns of burn severity. Fuel treatments that included recent prescribed burning of surface fuels were particularly effective at mitigating burn severity. Although surface and canopy fuel treatments are unlikely to substantially reduce the area burned in regional fire years, recent research, including this study, suggests that they can be an effective management strategy for increasing forest landscape resilience to wildfires.},

abstract = {The fires of summer 2003 in south-eastern Australia burnt tens of
thousands or hectares of treeless alpine landscape. Here, we examine
the environmental impact of these fires, using data from the Bogong
High Plains area of Victoria, and the Snowy Mountains region of New
South Wales. Historical and biophysical evidence suggests that in
Australian alpine environments, extensive fires occur only in periods
of extended regional drought, and when severe local fire weather
coincides with multiple ignitions in the surrounding montane forests.
Dendrochronological evidence indicates that large fires have occurred
approximately every 50-100 years over the past 400 years. Post-fire
monitoring of vegetation in grasslands and heathlands indicates that
most alpine species regenerate rapidly after fire, with >90% of
species present I year after fire. Some keystone species in some plant
communities, however, had not regenerated after 3 years. The responses
of alpine fauna to the 2003 fires were variable. The core habitat
(closed heathland) of several Vulnerable small mammals was extensively
burnt. Some mammals experienced Substantial falls in populations,
others experienced substantial increases. Unburnt patches of vegetation
are critical to faunal recovery from fire. There was, however, no
evidence of local extinction. We conclude that infrequent extensive
fires are a feature of alpine Australia. For both the flora and fauna,
there is no quantitative evidence that the 2003 fires were an
ecological disaster, and we conclude that the flora and fauna of alpine
Australia are highly resilient to infrequent, large, intense fires.},

This can be accomplished through the construction of a fire-origin map. The dynamic fire regime is a result of interactions among forest ecosystem components under various conditions. This paper examines the question of whether an ecological modelling approach could be helpful in providing a complementary solution for reconstructing natural fire regimes. Simulation of forest fire effects has been one component of the SEM-LAND model, and simulation results were validated by empirical observations from west-central Alberta, Canada. Model sensitivity analysis revealed that model behaviour was not influenced significantly by the initial forest age mosaic pattern and the critical value of daily precipitation that would be enough to stop a fire event. The methodology of simulating fire regimes is discussed. The ecological modelling approach could help forest managers evaluate proposed forest policy with emulation of natural disturbance patterns through harvesting},

Specifically, the multi-criteria framework enables recognition and handling of errors and uncertainties, and detection of prominent behavioural solutions with acceptable trade-offs. Particularly in models of complex parameterization, a multiobjective approach becomes essential for improving the identifiability of parameters and augmenting the information contained in calibration by means of both multi-response measurements and empirical metrics (“soft” data), which account for the hydrological expertise. Based on the literature review, we also provide alternative techniques for dealing with conflicting and non-commeasurable criteria, and hybrid strategies to utilize the information gained towards identifying promising compromise solutions that ensure consistent and reliable calibrations.},

The SAR is a central tool in conservation, being used to predict species loss following global climate change, and is striking in its universality throughout different geographical regions and across the tree of life. In this article we draw upon the methods of quantum field theory and the foundation of neutral community ecology to derive the first spatially explicit neutral prediction for the SAR. We find that the SAR has three phases, with a power law increase at intermediate scales, consistent with decades of documented empirical patterns. Our model also provides a building block for incorporating non-neutral biological variation, with the potential to bridge the gap between neutral and niche-based approaches to community assembly.},

abstract = {We discuss a method for analyzing data that are positively skewed and contain a substantial proportion of zeros. Such data commonly arise in ecological applications, when the focus is on the abundance of a species. The form of the distribution is then due to the patchy nature of the environment and/or the inherent heterogeneity of the species. The method can be used whenever we wish to model the data as a response variable in terms of one or more explanatory variables. The analysis consists of three stages. The first involves creating two sets of data from the original: one shows whether or not the species is present; the other indicates the logarithm of the abundance when it is present. These are referred to as the ‘presence data' and the ‘log-abundance' data, respectively. The second stage involves modelling the presence data using logistic regression, and separately modelling the log-abundance data using ordinary regression. Finally, the third stage involves combining the two models in order to estimate the expected abundance for a specific set of values of the explanatory variables. A common approach to analyzing this sort of data is to use a ln (y+c) transformation, where c is some constant (usually one). The method we use here avoids the need for an arbitrary choice of the value of c, and allows the modelling to be carried out in a natural and straightforward manner, using well-known regression techniques. The approach we put forward is not original, having been used in both conservation biology and fisheries. Our objectives in this paper are to (a) promote the application of this approach in a wide range of settings and (b) suggest that parametric bootstrapping be used to provide confidence limits for the estimate of expected abundance.},

abstract = {Estimates of leaf area index obtained with indirect measurement techniques, which are replacing more arduous destructive sampling methods, are frequently questioned due to light interception by woody elements and a non-random distribution of foliage elements. Usually, branches are assumed to be positioned randomly with respect to leaves or shoots in the canopy. However, in this study of boreal forest architecture, branches are shown to be preferentially shaded by other non-woody elements (e.g. shoots or leaves) in both coniferous and deciduous species of the boreal region. A new instrument called a Multiband Vegetation Imager (MVI) is used to capture two-band (Visible, 400±620 nm and Near-Infrared, 720±950 nm) image pairs of contrasting Canadian boreal forest canopies during the BOReal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). The spatial relationship of branches and photosynthetically active foliage is studied to estimate the fraction of the effective branch hemi-surface area index (Be) that is masked by leaves and shoots. We suggest an approach that corrects indirect LAI measurements using the LAI-2000 or a similar instrument by correcting for the following biases: (1) the effective canopy branch hemi-surface area that is not masked by leaves or shoots in the canopy, (2) the amount of stem hemi-surface area beneath crowns, (3) leaf (or shoot) ( e()) and branch ( b()) non-random spatial distributions in the canopy, and (4) the fraction of maximum LAI resulting from defoliation in the canopy. In boreal aspen, MVI image analysis shows that 95% of the effective branch hemi-surface area is masked by other foliage in the canopy. In jack pine and black spruce forests, 80±90% of the effective branch hemi-surface area is masked by other foliage in the canopy. These estimates suggest the fraction of indirect LAI that consists of branches intercepting light is less than 10%. Therefore, branches generally do not intercept a signi{\textregistered}cant amount of beam radiation in boreal forests, and do not signi{\textregistered}cantly bias indirect LAI measurements. However, stems, which comprise 30±50% of the total woody area in this study, may not be preferentially shaded by leafy foliage. Therefore, stem contribution to indirect LAI estimates measured with the LAI-2000 or a similar instrument cannot be overlooked. MVI estimates of the total branch hemi-surface area index agree to within 10±40% of direct measurements made in similar species; however, the error between indirect and direct measurements may be due largely to dif{\textregistered}culties associated with obtaining adequate sampling so that the error may fall within the noise level of measurements.},

This paper will review how the spatial structure of biological populations and communities can be studied. We first demonstrate that many of the basic statistical methods used in ecological studies are impaired by autocorrelated data. Most if not all environmental data fall in this category. We will look briefly at ways of performing valid statistical tests in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Methods now available for analysing the spatial structure of biological populations are described, and illustrated by vegetation data. These include various methods to test for the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the data: univariate methods (all-directional and two-dimensional spatial correlograms, and two dimensional spectral analysis), and the multivariate Mantel test and Mantel correlogram; other descrip tive methods of spatial structure: the univariate variogram, and the multivariate methods of clustering with spatial contiguity constraint; the partial Mantel test, presented here as a way of studying causal models that include space as an explanatory variable; and finally, various methods for mapping ecological variables and producing either univariate maps (interpolation, trend surface analysis, kriging) or maps of truly multivariate data (produced by constrained clustering). A table shows the methods classified in terms of the ecological questions they allow to resolve. Reference is made to available computer programs.},

We estimate carbon costs of constructing and maintaining buds, and review other costs and benefits of buds in different situations. Second, we develop a framework for thinking quantitatively about the costs and benefits. Given available data and some reasonable assumptions, the absolute carbon costs of buds seem small. So the fact that many species do not maintain bud banks suggests that the benefits of buds may be negligible for them. Alternatively, buds may carry other costs. Costs of bud protection or of reserves that are coordinated with buds seem likely candidates.},

abstract = {Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles repeatedly forced thermal zones up and down the slopes of mountains, at all latitudes. Although no one doubts that these temperature cycles have left their signature on contemporary patterns of geography and phylogeny, the relative roles of ecology and evolution are not well understood, especially for the tropics. To explore key mechanisms and their interactions in the context of chance events, we constructed a geographical range-based, stochastic simulation model that incorporates speciation, anagenetic evolution, niche conservatism, range shifts and extinctions under late Quaternary temperature cycles along tropical elevational gradients. In the model, elevational patterns of species richness arise from the differential survival of founder lineages, consolidated by speciation and the inheritance of thermal niche characteristics. The model yields a surprisingly rich variety of realistic patterns of phylogeny and biogeography, including close matches to a variety of contemporary elevational richness profiles from an elevational transect in Costa Rica. Mountaintop extinctions during interglacials and lowland extinctions at glacial maxima favour mid-elevation lineages, especially under the constraints of niche conservatism. Asymmetry in temperature (greater duration of glacial than of interglacial episodes) and in lateral area (greater land area at low than at high elevations) have opposing effects on lowland extinctions and the elevational pattern of species richness in the model-and perhaps in nature, as well.},

abstract = {This paper presents the development and validation results of a weighted small-world network model designed to simulate fire patterns in real heterogeneous landscapes. Fire spread is simulated on a gridded landscape, a mosaic in which each cell represents an area of the land surface. In this model, the interaction between burning and non-burning cells (here, due to flame radiation) may extend well beyond nearest neighbors, and depends on local conditions of wind, topography, and vegetation. An approach based on the coupling of the solid flame model with the Monte Carlo method is used to predict the radiative heat flux from the flame generated by the burning of each combustible cell to its neighbors. The weighting procedure takes into account latency (a combustible cell will only ignite when it has accumulated enough energy along time) and flaming persistence of burning cells. The model is applied to very different fire scenarios: a historical Mediterranean fire that occurred in southeastern France in 2005 and experimental fires conducted in arid savanna fuels in South Africa in 1992. Model results are found to be in agreement with real fire patterns, in terms both of rate of spread, and of the area and shape of the burn. This work also shows that the fractal properties of fire patterns predicted by the model are similar to those observed from satellite images of three other Mediterranean fire scars.

annote = {Doesn't mention self-organization, rather evaluates the self-similarity (fractal dimension) of fire perimeters.
Introduction, usual stochastic models (percolation, CA) only consider local contacts, so cannot mimic real fires well--they consider fire dynamics as completely diffusive, but long-range contacts (flame radiation and spotting of firebrands) can make propagation super-diffusive
Use a value p for the density of vegetation (combustible cells), and hose that "local small-world effects increase when p decreases", leading to a decrease in the fractal dimensions of the perimeter and burned area
At some point, the fractal dimensions remain nearly constand, indicating a quasi-steady-state of fire propagation is reached (seems opposite of the conclusion of Calderelli wrt SODP). fractal dimensions of the perimeter is observed for density of vegetation p=0.6.


Notes:
Not sure how the fire is stopped, other than observed duration (is that really the biggest problem in fire modelling?). Uses lots of physics in the underlying equations. Clearly trying to replicate fire events. What's the purpose of the model? Intended applications not really clear.},

abstract = {We describe a model to investigate the effects of high-severity fire and drought on ponderosa pine regeneration using a water balance approach. Based on literature reviews and an analysis of annual and monthly correlations against tree regeneration, climate envelopes are constructed to simulate conditions during the flowering, seed production, germination phase, seedling growth in the season following germination, and seedling growth in the 2 years following germination. The model was tested against observed regeneration at five sites in the Southwest that experienced high-severity fires during a drought from ca. 1945 to 1956. For validation purposes single fire events, as occurred at each field site, were simulated by altering maximum and minimum temperatures and runoff conditions in declining stages of severity for 7 years. To evaluate long term fire and climate impacts four sensitivity tests were conducted on climate records from 1914 through 2009: (1) a climate control with no modifications to temperature and precipitation inputs; (2) a permanently burned condition simulation; (3) a simulation where climate conditions were altered based on IPCC future climate change projections and; (4) a simulation with both climate change and fire modifications. Results show that annual data correlate poorly with ponderosa pine regeneration compared to monthly correlations. On average the model correctly predicts regeneration outcomes 62% of the time at the field sites. The sensitivity tests suggest that regeneration rates are reduced by 43% in post high-severity fire environments because of changed conditions during germination and post-germination establishment phases. Future climate projections result in mixed outcomes across the 5 sites and an average reduction of regeneration rates by 8%. Ponderosa pine forests on the dry end of the climate envelope are predicted to experience severe reduction in regeneration.},

abstract = {Architectural analyses of temperate tree species using a chronological approach suggest that the expression of epicormic branches is closely related to low growth rates in the axes that make up the branching system. Therefore, sole consideration of epicormic criteria may be sufficient to identify trees with low secondary growth levels or with both low primary and secondary growth levels. In a tropical tree such as Dicorynia guianensis (basralocus), where chronological studies are difficult, this relationship could be very useful as an easily accessible indicator of growth potentials. A simple method of architectural tree description was used to characterize the global structure of more than 1650 basralocus trees and to evaluate their growth level. Measurements of simple growth characters [height, basal diameter, internode length of submittal part (top of the main axis of the tree)] and the observation of four structural binary descriptors on the main stem (presence of sequential branches and young epicormic branches, state of the submittal part, global orientation), indicated that epicormic branch formation is clearly related to a decrease in length of the successive growth units of the main stem. Analysis of height vs. diameter ratios among different tree subgroups, with and without epicormic branching, suggested that trees with epicormic branches generally have a low level of secondary growth compared with primary growth.},

abstract = {Ecological interactions among individuals and disturbances are two important agents of pattern formation. In this study we investigated the interrelationships between interactions among individuals and large scale disturbances, and the resulting patterns. We categorized disturbances into three general classes, (1) those whose probability of occurrence increases with increased densities of vegetation, such as fire and disease, (2) those with a decreasing probability of occurrence with increasing vegetation densities, such as sand movement, and (3) disturbances that occur independently of vegetation densities, such as flooding. The ecological interactions among individuals were also divided to three classes: competition, facilitation and neutrality. We systematically investigated how these two types of processes interact to generate spatial patterns, using simulation models that were partially based on data collected from a shrub community in the Nizzana sand dune ecosystem. The results indicated that the different types of disturbances have fundamentally different effects on spatial patterns. Positive density-dependent disturbances, regardless of the type of interactions among individuals with which they were simulated, generated uniform spatial patterns. Patterns formed by interactions between decreasing or density independent disturbances with the different class interactions among individuals were more variable. These differences are attributed to the manner in which the difference disturbance types propagate in space.},

fuel hazards and restore ecosystem processes. The maintenance of
treatment effects under future climates is a critical issue. We
modelled forest change under different climate scenarios for 100 years
on ponderosa pine landscapes in the south-western USA, comparing
management regimes that included prescribed burning, tree cutting, and
no-management. We applied the Forest Vegetation Simulator (1) in its
standard form, and (2) with modifications of reduced tree growth and
increased mortality to simulate the effects of two levels of climate
change. Without climate change effects, several management regimes,
including the use of frequent burning similar to the historical fire
frequency (similar to 5 year), maintained future forest structure
within a target range of variability. In contrast, simulations that
accounted for climate change effects indicated that burning intervals
should be lengthened (similar to 20 year) and future tree thinning
should be avoided to minimise forest decline. Although it has been
widely predicted that future climate conditions will support more
burning (warmer, drier fuels, longer fire season), our modelling
suggests that the production of fuels will decline, so there will
eventually be a trade-off between increased fire, driven by climate, v.
reduced fuel, also driven by climate.},

We used remotely sensed burn-severity data from 125 fires in the northern Cascade Range of Washington, USA, to explore relationships between fire size, severity, and the spatial pattern of severity. We examined relationships between climate and the annual area burned and the size of wildfires over a 25-year period.

(MCA) method. The MCA is based on an additive utility model. The
relative importance of partial objectives of forest management (carbon
sequestration, ground water recharge, biodiversity, and timber
production) is defined in cooperation with stakeholders. The forest
growth model 4C (Forest Ecosystems in a Changing Environment) is used
to simulate the impact of six forest management strategies and climate
on forest functions. Two climate change scenarios represent
uncertainties with regard to future climatic conditions. The study is
based on actual forest conditions in the Kleinsee management unit in
east Germany, which is dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)
and oak (Quercus robur L. and Quercus petraea Liebl.) stands. First,
there is an analysis of the impact of climate and forest management on
forest functions. Climate change increases carbon sequestration and
income from timber production due to increased stand productivity.
Secondly, the overall utility of the management strategies is compared
under the priority settings of different stakeholder groups. From an
ecological perspective, a conservation strategy would be preferable
under all climate scenarios, but the business as usual management would
also fit the expectations under the current climate due to high
biodiversity and carbon sequestration in the forest ecosystem. In
contrast, a forest manager in public-owned forests or a private forest
owner would prefer a management strategy with an intermediate thinning
intensity and a high share of pine stands to enhance income from timber
production while maintaining the other forest functions.},

abstract = {A central challenge in ecology is understanding the emergence of
broad-scale community and ecosystem patterns as the result of
interactions among individuals. We identify the role of fine-scale light
heterogeneity in controlling broad-scale community behavior in SORTIE,
an empirically derived, stochastic forest simulation model. SORTIE
employs a very detailed measure of local light based on a 216-point
sample around every tree. We test the importance of this fine-scale
description of local light by reformulating SORTIE with less detail in
this algorithm. Predicted forests are compared at several scales from
total tree biomass (coarse grained) and patterns of forest succession to
the local spatial pattern of light availability at the forest floor
(fine grained). SORTIE is surprisingly insensitive to the amount of
detail used in the calculation of the local resource, light. In all
simulations, 48- and 16-point samples accurately reproduce the local
light environment and thus predict forest development without
appreciable error. A one-point sample of light significantly alters the
estimates of the local light environment, but the emergent forest
dynamics are insensitive to these alterations. The robustness of the
forest model to the altered light environment stems from two very
different mechanisms. First, the alterations of the light environment
have very short correlation lengths in time and space. This allows
fine-scale averaging to occur on the landscape. Second, the functional
relationships among light availability, growth rate, and mortality risk
in several key species tend to prevent the altered light environment
from affecting individual tree performance. These results demonstrate
that emergent forest dynamics in SORTIE do nor require detailed local
light estimation to capture the interaction between local resource
heterogeneity and the functional responses of trees. In addition, we
have shown that comparing model predictions at several scales provides a
strong methodology to identify relevant detail and understand scaling in
this model of a forest.},

Recent studies in cellular automata (CA) and the fractal nature of the frequency-area relationship they produce has led some authors to ask whether the power-law frequency-area statistics seen in the CA might also be present in empirical wildfire data. Here, we outline the history of the debate regarding the statistical wildfire frequency-area models suggested by the CA and their confrontation with empirical data. In particular, the extent to which the utility of these approaches is dependent on being placed in the context of self-organized criticality (SOC) is examined. We also consider some of the other heavy-tailed statistical distributions used to describe these data. Taking a broadly ecological perspective we suggest that this debate needs to take more interest in the mechanisms underlying the observed power-law (or other) statistics. From this perspective, future studies utilizing the techniques associated with CA and statistical physics will be better able to contribute to the understanding of ecological processes and systems.},

abstract = {We used a ground-based approach to compute the pyrogenic carbon emissions from the Biscuit Fire, an exceptionally large wildfire, which in 2002 burned over 200,000 ha of mixed conifer forest in southwestern Oregon. A combination of federal inventory data and supplementary ground measurements afforded the estimation of preburn densities for 25 separate carbon pools at 180 independent locations in the burn area. Average combustion factors for each of these pools were then compiled from the postburn assessment of thousands of individual trees, shrubs, and parcels of surface and ground fuel. Combustion factors were highest for litter, duff, and foliage, lowest for live woody pools. Combustion factors also increased with burn severity as independently assessed from remote imagery, endorsing the use of such imagery in scaling emissions to fire area. We estimate the total pyrogenic carbon emissions from the Biscuit Fire to be between 3.5 and 4.4 Tg C (17 and 22 Mg C ha1) depending on uncertainty in our ability to estimate preburn litter pools and mineral soil combustion with a central estimate of 3.8 Tg C (19 Mg C ha1). We estimate that this flux is approximately 16 times the annual net ecosystem production of this landscape prior to the wildfire and may have reduced mean net biome production across the state of Oregon by nearly half in the year 2002.},

Hydraulic systems of shrubs sampled along two transcontinental aridity gradients changed with increasing aridity from highly integrated to independently redundant modular designs. Shrubs in humid environments tend to be hydraulically integrated, with single, round basal stems, whereas dryland shrubs typically have modular hydraulic systems and multiple, segmented basal stems. Modularity is achieved anatomically at the vessel-network scale or developmentally at the whole-plant scale through asymmetric secondary growth, which results in a semiclonal or clonal shrub growth form that appears to be ubiquitous in global deserts.},

It is beyond the scope of this short chapter to attempt a synthesis of the diverse contents of the 21 preceding chapters, although all chapters are cited herein to point toward the present state-of-the-art. Rather than a retrospective, we use this final chapter to present a forward-looking view on the challenges and prospects for the 'emerging discipline' (Bond, 2003) of hydrology/ecohydrology and, in doing so, aim to focus attention on issues that require further evaluation and thought. We have suggested that a potential impediment to the development of ecohydrology/hydroecology is the lack of a clear subject definition to serve as a focal point to unite the research community (see Chapter 1). Most importantly, we assert herein that it is not simply the integration of hydrology and ecology that will determine the future prospects for ecohydrology/hydroecology but the way in which this integrative science is conducted. We advocate a truly interdisciplinary (as opposed to multidisciplinary) approaches in which ecologists and hydrologists benefit from genuine synergy by embracing advances at the cutting-edge of both sciences and unified, focused methodological stance. Such an approach should provide more perspective answers to hydroecological/ecohydrology problems and management questions.

We investigated how the amount and spatial arrangement of high-severity patches varied among 20 fires that occurred in Arizona and New Mexico, USA, across gradients in fire size and climate. The climate gradient was based on the Multivariate El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation Index. In the southwestern US, cool dry conditions are prevalent in La Ni{\~{n}}a at one extreme, and at the other end, warm wet conditions occur in El Ni{\~{n}}o. Fires were generally larger in La Ni{\~{n}}a climates; however, several fires deviated from this trend. Moreover, some spatial properties of severity did not correspond to fire size or to changes in climate. Within the nine largest fires, we analyzed the influence of landscape characteristics defined by topographic discontinuity on spatial patterns of fire severity. Characteristics of topography altered spatial patterns of severity at some places within all the nine fires, and we identified thresholds where small changes in terrain resulted in dramatic effects on severity. From a management perspective, consideration of the spatial configuration of severely burned areas can help qualify judgments based on fire size or severity composition alone by linking pattern to ecological processes of interest. Furthermore, examination of individual fire events could lead to identification of climate contexts in which fires can meet management objectives for sustainable forests},

abstract = {SUMMARY 1. At a local scale, the species composition, diversity and spatial variation of wetland plant communities are determined primarily by spatial and temporal heterogeneity in their environments. Less is known about variation at a landscape-level. The floodplain of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River in China includes hydrologically connected, subtropical wetlands with different hydrological characteristics. 2. We examined seed-bank species composition and richness in marshes of two contrasting hydrological types: permanent marshes, fed by local runoff, and lakeshore marshes more closely connected to the regulated river. Lakeshore marshes are flooded annually to depth of approximately 1 m and during flooding they support an alternate, aquatic vegetation type. The soil seed bank in March was a comparative estimator of species diversity. At the beginning of the growing season it included seeds from both phases of alternating vegetation types associated with the annual hydrological cycle. 3. A regional pool of 101 species was detected in the seed banks of six wetlands associated with the river and its tributaries: 56 occurred in permanent marshes and 59 in lakeshore marshes, with only 15 common to both. Species rarefaction curves indicated that more species occurred in permanent than lakeshore marshes at equal numbers of individuals sampled. However, the more heterogeneous lakeshore seed banks were estimated (Chao 2) to have greater total species richness (81) than permanent marsh (60). 4. Analysis using S{\o}rensen's coefficient of similarity and DCA ordination revealed complex variation, with much greater differences between hydrological types than within them, irrespective of geographical distance. The types also differed significantly in the composition of four functional groups of species. 5. Despite the potential for dispersal of propagules via the annually pulsing river system (hydrochory), at a regional and landscape scale, diversity is maintained largely by largescale temporal hydrological heterogeneity and smaller scale spatial and topographic heterogeneity.},

These data are characterised by a discrete distribution with the zero class inflated. In many statistical problems the parameters of this distribution depend on covariates, such as the number of hollow bearing trees. We advocate a conditional model which is simple to interpret and readily fitted. We show how to obtain standard errors for the parameter estimates. We also show how to estimate the mean abundance of animals at a site. The methods outlined in this paper offer a powerful framework for the study of problems having a discrete response (like abundance) with the zero class inflated.},

abstract = {Two determinants of crown fire hazard are canopy bulk density (CBD) and canopy base height (CBH). The Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FFE-FVS) is a model that predicts CBD and CBH. Currently, FFE-FVS accounts for neither geographic variation in tree allometries nor the nonuniform distribution of crown mass when one is estimating CBH and CBD. We develop allometric equations specific to ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) in the Black Hills to predict crown mass and use the Weibull distribution to model the vertical distribution of crown mass within individual trees. We present parameter prediction models that, in turn, predict the vertical distribution of crown mass based on stand- and tree-level attributes. With use of an FFE-FVS executable incorporating local crown mass equations and the parameter prediction models, new estimates of CBD and CBH were produced. Locally derived biomass equations predicted substantially greater estimates of foliage mass than currently predicted by FFE-FVS. The increase in CBD resulting from the local biomass and vertical distribution models averaged 78% over original estimates. Our results suggest that locally derived crown mass equations in addition to nonuniform estimates of crown mass distribution be used to calculate CBH and CBD as used in fire prediction models.},

To enhance forest resilience, a coordinated landscape fuel network was installed in the northern Sierra Nevada, which reduced the potential for hazardous fire, despite constraints for wildlife protection that limited the extent and intensity of treatments. Small mammal and songbird communities were largely unaffected by this landscape strategy, but the number of California spotted owl territories declined. The effects on owls could have been mitigated by increasing the spatial heterogeneity of fuel treatments and by using more prescribed fire or managed wildfire to better mimic historic vegetation patterns and processes. More landscape-scale experimentation with strategies that conserve key wildlife species while also improving forest resiliency is needed, especially in response to continued warming climates.},

In 1860 historical fire regimes and associated forest structure remained mostly intact; aerial photos of national forest lands in eastern Washington were taken 70–80 years later and used as historic reference points in regional resource assessments. We determined changes in stand age, tree density, and number of age cohorts per stand between 1860 and 1940. Also, we evaluated whether stand age-class structure in 1860 was in agreement with fire-scar analysis estimates of the historical fire regime. We developed a forest structure classification based on age cohorts and found that forest structural classes varied significantly (P < 0.001) from 1860 to 1940. From 1860 to 1940, average stand age increased by 26% and number of age cohorts per stand increased by 18%. Stands in stand initiation structural classes declined from 27% to 4%; stands in old forest structural classes increased from 23% to 49%. We suggest the 1940 photo record, previously used to assess historical conditions, may provide a false metric of structural complexity for historical dry fir-pine forests in eastern Washington.

abstract = {Elected offi cials and leaders of environmental agencies need information about the effects of large wildfi res in order to set policy and make management decisions. Recently, the Wildland Fire Leadership Council (WFLC), which implements and coordinates the National Fire Plan (NFP) and Federal Wildland Fire Management Policies (National Fire Plan, 2004), adopted a strategy to monitor the effectiveness of the National Fire Plan and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act (HFRA). One component of this strategy is to assess the environmental impacts of large wildland fi res and identify the trends of burn severity on all lands across the United States. To that end, WFLC has sponsored a six year project, Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS), which requires the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service (USDA-FS) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to map and assess the burn severity for all large current and historical fi res. Using Landsat data and the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) algorithm, the USGS Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) and USDA-FS Remote Sensing Applications Center will map burn severity of all fi res since 1984 greater than 500 acres in the east, and 1000 acres in the west. The number of historical fi res from this period combined with current fi res occurring during the course of the project will exceed 9000. The MTBS project will generate burn severity data, maps, and reports which will be available for use at local, state, and national levels to evaluate trends in burn severity and help develop and assess the effectiveness of land management decisions. Additionally, the information developed will provide a baseline from which to monitor the recovery and health of fi re-affected landscapes over time. Spatial and tabular data quantifying burn severity will augment existing information used to estimate risk associated with a range of current and future resource threats. The annual report of 2004 fi res has been completed. All data and results will be distributed to the public on a Web site.},

abstract = {The need to transfer information across a range of space-time scales (i.e., scaling) is coupled with the need to predict variables and processes of interest across landscapes. Agricultural landscapes offer a unique set of problems and space-time data availability with the onset of satellite-based positioning and crop yield monitoring. The present study addresses quantification of the spatial variability of rain-fed crop yield and near-surface soil water over a farm field using three methods: 1) geostatistical and fractal analysis; 2) non parametric estimation by Spatial Artificial Natural Networks (SANN). Method 1 is useful for scaling the spatial movements of each variable to determine appropriate scales of measurement and management. Methods 2 and 3 take advantage of empirical and process knowledge of topographic controls on water movement and microenvironments, where topographic attributes estimated from a digital elevation model at some scale (10m by 10m here) help explain the observed spatial variability in crop yield. Soil water (top 30 cm) displays more random spatial variability, and its dynamic nature makes it difficult to predict in both space and time. Despite such variability, spatial structure is evident and can be approximated by simple fractals out to lag distances of about 400 m. The SANN technique is more flexible than point-to-point parametric correlations, including the use of spatial activation functions for interpolation within a field. Using topographic attributes as input, SANN provides a minimum prediction error of 0.57 relative root mean squared error (RRMSE) for crop yield in 1997, which explains 68% of the spatial variance compared with 48% for MLR. Within field interpolation (adding the easting and northing as inputs) reduced the RRMSE to 0.47 (R^2=0.78).},

In order to give perspective to patterns of change over time, it emphasizes the integration of paleoecological studies with studies of modern ecosystems. Data from a range of spatial scales, from individual plants to communities and ecosystems to landscape and regional levels, are included. Contributions come from fire ecology, paleoecology, biogeography, paleoclimatology, landscape and ecosystem ecology, ecological modeling, forest management, plant community ecology and plant morphology. The book gives a synthetic overview of methods, data and simulation models for evaluating fire regime processes in forests, shrublands and woodlands and assembles case studies of fire, climate and land use histories. The unique approach of this book gives researchers the benefits of a north-south comparison as well as the integration of paleoecological histories, current ecosystem dynamics and modeling of future changes},

abstract = {This paper describes the methodologies used to develop a prediction model to assist health workers in developing countries in facing one of the most of the most difficult health problems in all parts of the world; the presentation of an acutely ill young infant. Statistical approaches for developing the clinical prediction model faced at least two major difficulties. First, the number of predictor variables, especially clinical signs and symptoms, is very large, necessitating the use of data reduction techniques that are blinded to the outcome. Second, there is no uniquely accepted continuous outcome measure or final binary diagnostic criterion. For example, the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis is ill defined. Clinical decision makers must identify infants likely to have positive cultures as well as to grade the severity of illness. In the WHO/ARI Young Infant Multicentre Study we have found an ordinal outcome scale made up of a mixture of laboratory and diagnostic markers to have several clinical advantages as well as to increase the power of tests for risk factors. Such a mixed ordinal scale does present statistical challenges because it may violate constant slope assumptions of ordinal regression models. In this paper we develop and validate an ordinal predictive model after choosing a data reduction technique. We show how ordinality of the outcome is checked against each predictor. We describe new but simple techniques for graphically examining residuals from ordinal logistic models to detect problems with variable transformations as well as to detect non-proportional odds other lack of fit. We examine an alternative type of ordinal logistic model, the continuation ratio model, to determine if it provides a better fit. We find that it does not but that this model is easily modified to allow the regression coefficients to vary with cut-offs of the response variable. Complex terms in this extend model are penalized to allow only as much complexity as the data will support. We approximate the extended continuation ratio model with a model with fewer terms to allow us to draw a nomogram for obtaining various predictions. The model is validated for calibration and discrimination using the bootstrap. We apply much of the modeling strategy decided in Harrell, Lee and Mark (Statist. Med. 15, 361-387 (1998)) for survival analysis, adapting it to ordinal logistic regression and further emphasizing penalized maximum likelihood estimation and data reduction.},

abstract = {Aim In this study, we evaluated the fire-forest mosaic of a mixed conifer forest landscape by testing the hypothesis that pre-fire suppression fire regime parameters vary with species composition (tree species), and environment (i.e. slope aspect, slope position, elevation). Location Our study was conducted in the 1587 ha Cub Creek Research Natural Area (CCRNA), Lassen National Forest, CA, USA. Methods We quantified the return interval, seasonal occurrence, size, rotation period, and severity of fires using dendroecology. Results Slope aspect, potential soil moisture, forest composition, and fire regime parameters in our study area co-vary. Median composite and point fire return intervals (FRI) were longest on higher, cooler, more mesic, north-facing (NF) slopes covered with white fir (Abies concolor), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)-white fir, and red fir (A. magnifica)-white fir forests, shortest on the dry, south-facing (SF) slopes covered with ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)-white fir forests and intermediate on west-facing slopes dominated by white fir-sugar pine (P. lambertiana)-incense cedar (Libocedrus decurrens) forests. The spatial pattern for length of fire rotation (FR) was the same as that for FRI. Fires in CCRNA mixed conifer forests occurred mainly (90%) in the dormant season. Size of burns in CCRNA mixed conifer forests were generally small (mean = 106 ha), however, during certain drought years widespread fires burned across fuel breaks and spread throughout the watershed. Fire severity was mainly high on upper slopes, low on lower slopes and moderate and low severity on middle slopes. Patterns of fire severity also varied with slope aspect. Fire frequency decreased dramatically in CCRNA after 1905. Conclusions In CCRNA, fire regime parameters [e.g. FRI, fire extent, FR, fire severity] varied widely with species composition, slope aspect and slope position. There was also temporal variation in fire extent with the most widespread fires occurring during drought years. The important contributions of topography and climate to variation in the fire regime indicates that exogenous factors play a key role in shaping the fire-forest structure mosaic and that the fire-forest structure mosaic is more variable, less predictable and less stable than previously thought. Finally, some characteristics of the fire regime (i.e. fire severity, season of burn) in CCRNA are different than those described for other mixed conifer forests and this suggests that there are geographical differences in mixed conifer fire regimes along the Pacific slope.},

abstract = {1 Severe winds are the predominant cause of natural disturbance in
temperate forests of north-eastern and north-central North America.
Conceptual models of the effects of wind disturbance have traditionally
focused on the impacts of catastrophic disturbances and have painted a
simple picture of how disturbance acts to maintain tree species
diversity. These models ignore variation among species characteristics
that could have important consequences for both resistance to and
recovery from disturbance.
2 We integrated an empirically parameterized, mechanistic model of
windstorm mortality (WINDSTORM) and a seed-mass-based dispersal and
recruitment model into a spatially explicit, individual tree model of
forest dynamics (SORTIE) in order to create simulated long-term
`experiments' designed to explore the sensitivity of forest composition
and structure to species-specific resistance to and recovery from
disturbance.
3 We found that species-specific variation in resistance to wind
mortality interacted strongly with: (i) shade tolerance characteristics,
(ii) the medium-term history of disturbances, (iii) the long-term
average severity of the disturbance regime and (iv) seedbed substrate
dynamics to influence tree population dynamics and successional
trajectories.
4 We also examined how local and long-distance dispersal affect response
to wind disturbance. Ignoring differences among local dispersal
characteristics overestimates the importance of dispersal-limited
species. Our results show that long-distance immigration maintains
species coexistence only if the immigration rate is very high relative
to local dispersal. Despite this, stand-scale models that ignore
long-distance dispersal can underestimate population dynamics of
dispersal-limited species.
5 Our results indicate that landscape-scale heterogeneity in structure
and species composition in these forests is facilitated by synergisms
between the stochastic nature of wind disturbance and complex
interactions between species traits that govern: (i) resistance to
disturbance, (ii) local dispersal and seedling establishment and (iii)
competitive (i.e. growth/survival) traits that do not adhere to strict
tradeoffs.
6 We conclude that wind disturbance has much more complex and variable
effects on long-term dynamics of forest structure and composition than
suggested by previous models. In particular, non-catastrophic
disturbances can generate important variation in forest dynamics that
can either lead to dominance by a single or small number of species, or
facilitate species coexistence.},

We describe a multi-objective mathematical programming model to quantify tradeoffs in expected sediment delivery and the preservation of Northern spotted owl (NSO) habitat following fuel treatments to reduce fire hazard in the Deschutes National forest in Central Oregon, USA. Our model integrates the management objective of fire hazard reduction and the provision of ecosystem services (water quality and NSO habitat protection) and helps evaluate tradeoffs among them. Our results suggest significant reductions in fire hazard can be achieved without compromising any NSO habitat by strategically placing the treatments; however, the treatments will lead to a short term increase in sediment delivery. An analysis of environmental risks showed that over the longer term, the increase in sediment delivery and NSO habitat loss caused by wildfires would be 30–50% greater in areas without fuel treatments. The use of the multi-objective optimization model described in this study can help managers quantify and assess potential tradeoffs among ecosystem services and provide data for more informed decision making.},

abstract = {We assessed the effectiveness of forest fuel thinning projects that explicitly removed surface and ladder fuels (all but one were combined mechanical and prescribed fire/pile burn prescriptions) in reducing fire severity and tree mortality in 12 forest fires that burned in eastern and southern California between 2005 and 2011. All treatments and fires occurred in yellow pine or mixed conifer forests, in a variety of land- scape conditions. Most fires burned under warm, dry conditions, with moderate to high winds. With few exceptions, fire severity measures (bole char height, scorch and torch height, scorch and torch percent- age) and tree mortality were much lower in forest stands treated for fuels than in neighboring untreated stands. Fire-tolerant species like Pinus jeffreyi and Pinus ponderosa exhibited much higher postfire survi- vorship than fire-intolerant species like Abies concolor. Among variables related to fire weather, fuel load- ing, and treatment age, ten-hour fuel moisture was found to be a better predictor of tree survival in untreated stands than in treated stands, while fuel loading was a better predictor of survival in treated stands. We did not find an effect of treatment age, but our oldest treatments (nine years when burned) were below the mean pre-Euroamerican settlement fire return interval for these forest types. Within treatments, fire severity decreased with distance from the treatment boundary, and canopy fires were almost always reduced to surface fires within 70m of entering the treatment. In California yellow pine and mixed conifer forests, treatment prescriptions should allow for levels of fire-driven canopy tree mor- tality (c. 5–15%) that better mimic natural fires. Our results add significantly to the growing evidence that fuel treatments that include removal of surface and ladder fuels in these forest types are highly effective management tools for reducing fire severity and canopy tree mortality. In our opinion, quantitative assessments of fuel treatment effects on fire severity in frequent-fire forest types hardly merit further effort. Rather, we suggest that future work focus on documenting and comparing other ecological out- comes of fuel treatments in burned and unburned forest, such as effects on plant and animal diversity, soil conditions, and habitat heterogeneity},

abstract = {Abstract  Fire regimes are complex systems that represent an aggregate of spatial and temporal events whose statistical properties are scale dependent. Despite the breadth of research regarding the spatial controls on fire regime variability, few datasets are available with sufficient resolution to test spatially explicit hypotheses. We used a spatially distributed network of georeferenced fire-scarred trees to investigate the spatial structure of fire occurrence at multiple scales. Mantel's tests and geostatistical analysis of fire-occurrence time series led to inferences about the mechanisms that generated spatial patterns of historical fire synchrony (multiple trees recording fire in a single year) in eastern Washington, USA. The spatial autocorrelation structure of historical fire regimes varied within and among sites, with clearer patterns in the complex rugged terrain of the Cascade Range than in more open and rolling terrain further north and east. Results illustrate that the statistical spatial characteristics of fire regimes change with landform characteristics within a forest type, suggesting that simple relationships between fire frequency, fire synchrony, and forest type do not exist. Quantifying the spatial structures in fire occurrence associated with topographic variation showed that fire regime variability depends on both landscape structure and the scale of measurement. Spatially explicit fire-scar data open new possibilities for analysis and interpretation, potentially informing the design and application of fire management on landscapes, including hazardous fuel treatments and the use of fire for ecosystem restoration.},

abstract = {Species distributions models (SDMs) are commonly used to assess potential species' range shifts or extinction risk under climate change. It has been suggested that the use of ensemble forecasts, where a variety of model algorithms are used to generate consensus predictions, are preferred to individual SDMs by avoiding bias or prediction error inherent in a single modeling approach. Whereas several studies have assessed the performance of ensemble predictions using cross-validation or data-partitioning approaches, few studies have assessed the predictive accuracy of ensemble forecasts under climate change by using temporally independent model validation data. We used five SDM approaches to develop consensus forecasts of distributions of 145 vascular plant species from California in the 1930s and tested their projections against current distributions, a span of approximately 75 years. When evaluated with a portion of the model training data, consensus forecasts were highly accurate with an average AUC value of 0.97. False positive and false negative error rates were also low, exhibiting similar performance to random forest models. However, when evaluated with temporally independent data, the accuracy of consensus forecasts was similar to that of generalized linear and generalized additive models, with an average AUC value of 0.83. Our results suggest that the high levels of predictive accuracy exhibited by consensus forecasts when using data partitioning approaches may not reflect their performance when predicting temporally independent data. We contend that consensus forecasts may not represent the best approach for predicting species distributions under future climatic change, as they may not provide superior predictive accuracy in novel temporal domains compared to traditional modeling approaches that more readily lend themselves to ecological interpretation of model structure.},

abstract = {This study presents a new interactive procedure for supporting Decision Makers (DMs) in environmental planning problems involving large, process-based, dynamic models and many (more than two) conflicting objectives. Because of such features of the model, computationally-onerous simulations are the only feasible way of analysis, while the multi-objective nature of the problem entails the combined use of optimization techniques and appropriate tools for the visualization of the associated Pareto frontier. The procedure proposed is based on the iterative improvement of the current best compromise alternative based on interactions with the DM. At each iteration, the DM is informed about the Pareto frontier of a local multi-objective optimization problem, which is generated by linearizing the response surfaces that describe the objectives and constraints of the original planning problem. Interactive visualization of the multi-dimensional Pareto frontier is used to support the DM in choosing the new best compromise alternative. The procedure terminates when the DM is fully satisfied with the current best compromise alternative. The approach is demonstrated in Googong Reservoir (Australia), which is periodically affected by high concentrations of Manganese and Cyanobacteria. Results indicate that substantial improvements could be observed by simply changing the location of the two mixers installed in 2007 and adding another pair of mixers.},

abstract = {Statistical models are the traditional choice to test scientific theories when observations, processes or boundary conditions are subject to stochasticity. Many important systems in ecology and biology, however, are difficult to capture with statistical models. Stochastic simulation models offer an alternative, but they were hitherto associated with a major disadvantage: their likelihood functions can usually not be calculated explicitly, and thus it is difficult to couple them to well-established statistical theory such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. A number of new methods, among them Approximate Bayesian Computing and Pattern-Oriented Modelling, bypass this limitation. These methods share three main principles: aggregation of simulated and observed data via summary statistics, likelihood approximation based on the summary statistics, and efficient sampling. We discuss principles as well as advantages and caveats of these methods, and demonstrate their potential for integrating stochastic simulation models into a unified framework for statistical modelling.},

abstract = {Previous studies have debated the flammability of young regenerating stands, especially those in a matrix of mature forest, and no consensus has emerged as to whether young stands are inherently prone to highseverity wildfire. This topic has recently been addressed using spatial imagery, and weak inferences were made given the scale mismatch between the coarse resolution of spatial imagery and the fine resolution of mechanisms driving fire severity. We collected empirical stand and fire-severity data from 44 regenerating stands that are interspersed in mature, mid-elevation forests in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest (OWNF) on the eastside of the Cascade Range in Washington, USA. These stands are mixed-species plantations that were established to promote regeneration of seral to late-seral tree species (Douglas-fir, subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, western larch) in small patches within a larger lodgepole pine forest. In 2006, the 70,925 ha Tripod Fire burned through all the plantations and the surrounding lodgepole pine matrix. To understand what drives fire effects in plantations, especially those that exist in spatially heterogeneous forests, we compared fire severity in plantations with and without fuels-reducing site preparation (i.e., fuel treatments), using three metrics to quantify severity: mortality (%), exposed mineral soil (%), and char height (m). We built generalized linear models for each severity metric and tested for a difference in all severity metrics between treated and untreated units using Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance. Units without fuel treatments have more severe fire effects: mortality is 77% in untreated units and 37% in treated units (p = 0.0005). Other variables contribute to differences in fire severity, including species composition, canopy closure, and canopy base height. Canopy base height and canopy closure both exhibit a reverse relationship with mortality from what was expected: the higher the canopy closure and the lower the canopy base height, the lower the mortality. In other words, stands that have trees closer together with crowns near the ground are more likely to have lower mortality. Overall, the results suggest that young stands in some dry mixed conifer forests can be resilient to wildfire if surface fuel loading is low upon stand establishment.},

abstract = {The Coarse Woody Debris (CWD) quantity, defined as biomass per unit area (t/ha), and the quality, defined as the proportion of standing dead logs to the total CWD quantity, greatly contribute to many ecological processes such as forest nutrient cycling, tree regeneration, wildlife habitat, fire dynamics, and carbon dynamics. However, a cost-effective and time-saving method to determine CWD is not available. Very limited literature could be found that applies remote sensing technique to CWD inventory. In this paper, we fused the wall-to-wall multi-frequency and multi-polarization Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AirSAR) and optical Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) to estimate the quantity and quality of CWD in Yellowstone post-fire forest ecosystem, where the severe 1988 fire event resulted in high spatial heterogeneity of dead logs. To relate backscatter values to CWD metrics, we first reduced the terrain effect to remove the interference of topography on AirSAR backscatter. Secondly, we removed the influence of regenerating sapling by quadratic polynomial fitting between AVIRIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and different channels backscatters. The quantity of CWD was derived from Phh and Phv, and the quality of CWD was derived from Phh aided by the ratio of Lhv and Phh. Two maps of Yellowstone post-fire CWD quantity and quality were produced. The calculated CWD quantity and quality were validated by extensive field surveys. Regarding CWD quantity, the correlation coefficient between measured and predicted CWD is only 0.54 with mean absolute error up to 29.1 t/ha. However, if the CWD quantity was discretely classified into three categories of "≤ 60", "60-120", and "≥ 120", the overall accuracy is 65.6{%}; if classified into two categories of "≤ 90" and "≥ 90", the overall accuracy is 73.1{%}; if classified into two categories of "≤ 60" and "≥ 60", the overall accuracy is 84.9{%}. This indicates our attempt to map CWD quantity spatially and continuously achieved partial success; however, the general and discrete categories are reasonable. Regarding CWD quality, the overall accuracy of 5 types (Type 1-standing CWD ratio ≥ 40{%}; Type 2-15{%} ≤ standing CWD ratio {<} 40{%}; Type 3-7{%} ≤ standing CWD ratio{<} 15{%}; Type 4-3{%} ≤ standing CWD ratio {<} 7{%}; Type 5-standing CWD ratio {<} 3{%}) is only 40.32{%}. However, when type 1, 2, 3 are combined into one category and type 4 and 5 are combined into one category, the overall accuracy is 67.74{%}. This indicates the partial success of our initial results to map CWD quality into detailed categories, but the result is acceptable if solely very coarse CWD quality is considered. Bias can be attributed to the complex influence of many factors, such as field survey error, sapling compensation, terrain effect reduction, surface properties, and backscatter mechanism understanding. {{\textcopyright}} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

The backlog of areas in need of restoration combined with limited budgets requires that projects are implemented according to a prioritization system. The current system uses a stand-scale metric that measures ecological departure from pre-settlement conditions. Although conceptually appealing, the approach does not consider important spatial factors that influence both the efficiency and feasibility of managing future fire in the post-treatment landscape.

abstract = {Extensive beetle outbreaks across western North American forests have spurred debates about how to best protect communities from wildfire. Previous work has found that fuels in the wildland–urban interface and especially in the defensible space (40-m radius) around structures are the most important determinants of the flammability of structures during wildfire. We: (1) examined the extent of outbreaks in the western US and their intersection with the wildland-urban interface and its surrounding area and (2) calculated the combined area of defensible space around all wildland-urban interface housing units in the western US. This analysis indicates that: (1) .98% of areas affected by outbreaks are in remote areas rather than in the wildland-urban interface and (2) in the context of limited resources and the goal of protecting homes and communities from wildfire, the area required to create defensible space around all homes in the wildland-urban interface of the western US (which effectively reduces fire risk to structures) is substantially less than that needed to treat all beetle-affected forests (which does not reduce fire risk to structures as effectively). Thus, focussing fuelreduction treatments in the immediate vicinity of homes and communities rather than in remote beetle-affected forests would be more effective at reducing fire risk to those structures and would incur lower financial and ecological costs.},

abstract = {Fuel treatments are being implemented on public and private lands across the western United States. Although scientists and managers have an understanding of how fuel treatments can modify potential fire behaviour under modelled conditions, there is limited information on how treatments perform under real wildfire conditions in Sierran mixed conifer forests. The Bell Fire started on 22 September 2005 on the Plumas National Forest, CA. This fire burned upslope into a 1-year old, 158-ha mechanical fuel treatment on private land. Prior to coming into contact with the fuel treatment, the main fire ignited spot fires 400 feet (122 metres) into the treated area. Overall, this fuel treatment resulted in: (1) increased penetration of retardant to surface fuels; (2) improved visual contact between fire crews and the Incident Commander; (3) safe access to the main fire; and (4) quick suppression of spot fires. This treatment was relatively small and isolated from other fuel treatments but resulted in decreased severity, suppression costs and post-fire rehabilitation needs, leading to cost savings for local public and private land managers.},

abstract = {Historical forest conditions in frequent-fire forests may be increasingly useful in guiding contemporary forest management given (1) projections for increased drought stress associated with climate change and (2) increases in vertical and horizontal fuel connectivity related to changes in land use over the past 150 years. Records from a 1922–25 timber inventory reveal historical variability at the landscape-level on mixed-conifer habitats on the eastern slopes of the Cascade Range in northern Oregon. Live conifers >15 cm dbh (diameter at breast height) were tallied by species and diameter class in a 20% sample of over 50,000 hectares (ha). Forests were predominantly low density (66 tph, standard deviation = 32, range = 0–289) relative to current conditions (312 ± 245, 0–1643 tph). Historical basal area averaged 14 ± 7 (0–70) m2 ha1. Total stand density, large tree (>53 cm dbh) density, and ponderosa pine density were relatively stable across a wide moisture gradient (42–187 cm annual precipitation). Large trees dominated total basal area (73 ± 16%) and comprised 42 ± 17% of total trees per hectare (tph). Ponderosa pine contributed 62 ± 27% of basal area. Together, ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir constituted 91 ± 15% of basal area. Large ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir were nearly ubiquitous across the landscape in this historical data set, occurring on 94% and 83% of transects respectively. Large grand fir occurred on 20% of transects but contributed only 2 ± 6% to large tree basal area. Higher-density values (>120 tph), although rare, were distributed throughout the mixed-conifer habitat while large (>1.6 ha) treeless (no conifers >15 cm dbh) areas were almost entirely restricted to higher elevation, colder, wetter habitat types. Currently ponderosa pine no longer dominates large tree basal area, large trees no longer dominate total basal area, and Douglas-fir is now the dominant species across the landscape. Current mean tree densities are more than four times greater than values recorded in the historical cruise, and current basal area is approximately two times greater. Currently, large trees dominate basal area on only 29% of area inventoried compared to 91% in 1922–25. This systematic sample of a large landscape provides information about variability in species composition, densities, and structures at multiple spatial scales, which are highly relevant to management activities to restore and conserve desired ecosystem functions. Forest conditions comparable to those in this historical record have demonstrated resilience and resistance to fire and drought-related stressors in other frequent-fire forests.},

abstract = {The Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA) Wilderness of northern Minnesota, USA, ememplifies how fire management and natural disturbance determine forest composition and landscape structure at a broad scale. Historically, the BWCA (> 400,000 ha) was subject to crown fires with a mean rotation period of 50-100 y. Fires often overlapped, creating a mosaic of differently aged stands with many stands burning frequently or, alternatively, escaping fire for several centuries. The BWCA may never have reached a steady-state (defined as a stable landscape age-class structure). In the early 1900s, a diminished fire regime began creating a more demographically diverse forest, characterized by increasingly uneven-aged stands. Shade-tolerant species typical of the region began replacing the shade-in tolerant species that composed the fire-generated even-aged stands. Red pine (Pinus resinosa) stands are relatively uncommon in the BWCA today and are of special concern. The replacement of early-to-midsuccessional species is occurring at the scale of individual gaps, producing mixed-species multiaged forests. We used LANDIS, a spatially explicit forest landscape model, to investigate the long-term consequences of fire reintroduction or continuing fire absence on forest composition and landscape structure. Fire reintroduction was evaluated at three potential mean fire rotation periods (FRP): 50,100, and 300 y. Our model scenarios predict that if fire reintroduction mimics the natural fire regime (bracketed by FRP = 50 and 100 y), it will be most successful at preserving the original species composition and landscape structure, although jack pine (Pinus banksiana) may require special management. With limited fire reintroduction, all of the extant species are retained although species dominance and landscape structure will be substantially altered. If fire remains absent, many fire-dependent species will be lost as local dominants, including red pine. The landscape appears to be in a state of rapid change and a shift in management to promote fire may need to be implemented soon to prevent further deviation from historic, presettlement conditions.},

abstract = {Under a rapidly warming climate, a critical management issue in semiarid forests of western North America is how to increase forest resilience to wildfire. We evaluated relationships between fuel reduction treatments and burn severity in the 2006 Tripod Complex fires, which burned over 70,000 ha of mixed-conifer forests in the North Cascades range of Washington State and involved 387 past harvest and fuel treatment units. A secondary objective was to investigate other drivers of burn severity including landform, weather, vegetation characteristics, and a recent mountain pine beetle outbreak. We used sequential autoregression (SAR) to evaluate drivers of burn severity, represented by the relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio index, in two study areas that are centered on early progressions of the wildfire complex. Significant predictor variables include treatment type, landform (elevation), fire weather (minimum relative humidity and maximum temperature), and vegetation characteristics, including canopy closure, cover type, and mountain pine beetle attack. Recent mountain pine beetle damage was a statistically significant predictor variable with red and mixed classes of beetle attack associated with higher burn severity. Treatment age and size were only weakly correlated with burn severity and may be partly explained by the lack of treatments older than 30 years and the low rates of fuel succession in these semiarid forests. Even during extreme weather, fuel conditions and landform strongly influenced patterns of burn severity. Fuel treatments that included recent prescribed burning of surface fuels were particularly effective at mitigating burn severity. Although surface and canopy fuel treatments are unlikely to substantially reduce the area burned in regional fire years, recent research, including this study, suggests that they can be an effective management strategy for increasing forest landscape resilience to wildfires.},

Such transition ranges are associated with critical environmental conditions such as tree density. As the landscape becomes dissected into smaller patches of trees, landscape connectivity may suddenly become disrupted, which may have im- portant consequences for the behaviours of forest re, i.e. how it spreads. Landscape connectivity depends not only on the tree density but also many other environmental conditions such as land height, ammability, and wind conditions. To determine how the critical densities are a ected by the changes in these conditions, we developed a re spread simulation model using a multi-agent (i.e. bottom-up) approach. This model sim- ulates an arti cial environment where bush is randomly generated and re can be ignited and then spread across the environment according to some \interaction rules". The emer- gent re spread behaviours at the landscape level are determined by such micro-level \interaction rules".

American boreal biome for its applicability in modelling forest cover
change over large extents. At broader scales, forest succession can be
viewed as forest cover change over time. Quantitative case studies of
forest succession in peer-reviewed literature are reliable sources of
information about changes in forest canopy composition. We reviewed the
following aspects of forest succession in literature: disturbances;
pathways of post-disturbance forest cover change; timing of successional
steps; probabilities of post-disturbance forest cover change, and
effects of geographic location and ecological site conditions on forest
cover change. The results from studies in the literature, which were
mostly based on sample plot observations, appeared to be sufficient to
describe boreal forest cover change as a generalized discrete-state
transition process, with the discrete states denoted by tree species
dominance. In this paper, we outline an approach for incorporating
published knowledge on forest succession into stochastic simulation
models of boreal forest cover change in a standardized manner. We found
that the lack of details in the literature on long-term forest
succession, particularly on the influence of pre-disturbance forest
cover composition, may be limiting factors in parameterizing simulation
models. We suggest that the simulation models based on published
information can provide a good foundation as null models, which can be
further calibrated as detailed quantitative information on forest cover
change becomes available.},

As a preferable modelling approach, the cellular automaton (CA) has been used to simulate the complex mechanisms of fire spreading. However, in traditional CA models, comprehensive studies on the physical principles of forest fires are needed to define the local transition rules. Instead of defining transition rules, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) was applied in this study. By integrating the ELM with the traditional forest fire CA framework, a new cellular automaton modelling approach was proposed. After that, its performance was validated using data collected from five fires in the west of United States. Results show that the ELM performed well in predicting each cell's igniting probability. The impact of wind velocity on fire spreading pattern can be effectively described by the proposed modelling approach. Furthermore, the validation against actual fire behavior observations shows that its simulation performance is acceptable and in most cases is better than that of the previously reported studies.},

abstract = {Wildland fire management is subject to manifold sources of uncertainty. Beyond the unpredictability of wildfire behavior, uncertainty stems from inaccurate/missing data, limited resource value measures to guide prioritization across fires and resources at risk, and an incomplete scientific understanding of ecological response to fire, of fire behavior response to treatments, and of spatiotemporal dynamics involving disturbance regimes and climate change. This work attempts to systematically align sources of uncertainty with the most appropriate decision support methodologies, in order to facilitate cost-effective, risk-based wildfire planning efforts. We review the state of wildfire risk assessment and management, with a specific focus on uncertainties challenging implementation of integrated risk assessments that consider a suite of human and ecological values. Recent advances in wildfire simulation and geospatial mapping of highly valued resources have enabled robust risk-based analyses to inform planning across a variety of scales, although improvements are needed in fire behavior and ignition occurrence models. A key remaining challenge is a better characterization of non-market resources at risk, both in terms of their response to fire and how society values those resources. Our findings echo earlier literature identifying wildfire effects analysis and value uncertainty as the primary challenges to integrated wildfire risk assessment and wildfire management. We stress the importance of identifying and characterizing uncertainties in order to better quantify and manage them. Leveraging the most appropriate decision support tools can facilitate wildfire risk assessment and ideally improve decision-making. ?? 2011.},

Robust risk-assessment tools are required that account for highly variable effects on multiple values-at-risk and balance competing objectives, to support decision making. Providing wildland fire managers with risk-analysis tools requires a broad scientific foundation in fire behaviour and effects prediction as well as high quality computer-based tools and associated databases. We outline a wildfire risk-assessment approach, highlight recent developments in fire effects science and associated research needs, and recommend developing a comprehensive plan for integrated advances in wildfire occurrence, behaviour and effects research leading to improved decision support tools for wildland fire managers. We find that the current state of development in fire behaviour and effects science imposes severe limits on the development of risk-assessment technology. In turn, the development of technology has been largely disconnected from the research enterprise, resulting in a confusing array of ad hoc tools that only partially meet decision-support needs for fuel and fire management. We make the case for defining a common risk-based analytic framework for fire-effects assessment across the range of fire-management activities and developing a research function to support the framework.},

We evaluated the influence of fuel treatment, tree size and species on tree mortality following a large wildfire event in recent thin-only, thin and prescribed burn (thin-Rx) units. Of the trees that died within the first 3 years, most died in the first year regardless of treatment. First-year mortality was much higher in control and thin-only units (65 and 52%) than in thin-Rx units (37%). Cumulative third-year mortality followed a similar trend (78 and 64% in control and thin-only units) v. 43% in thin-Rx units. Percentage crown scorch is a strong predictor of mortality and is highly dependent on fuel treatment. Across all treatments, Pinus ponderosa had a lower probability of post-fire mortality than did Pseudotsuga menziesii. Finally, the probability of beetle attack on surviving trees was highest in large-diameter trees within thin-only treatments and lowest within thin-Rx treatments. This study contributes further evidence supporting the effectiveness of thinning and prescribed burning on mitigating post-fire tree mortality. We also present evidence that a combination of thinning and prescribed burning is associated with lower incidence of post-fire bark beetle attack},

The goals of this study include (i) analysis of the applicability of multiobjective approach for WetSpa calibration instead of the traditional approach, i.e. the Parameter ESTimator software (PEST), and (ii) identifiability assessment of model parameters. The objective functions considered are model efficiency (Nash-Sutcliffe criterion) known to be biased for high flows, and model efficiency for logarithmic transformed discharges to emphasize low-flow values. For the multi-objective approach, Pareto-optimal parameter sets are derived, whereas for the single-objective formulation, PEST is applied to give optimal parameter sets. The two approaches are evaluated by applying the WetSpa model to predict daily discharges in the Hornad River (Slovakia) for a 10 year period (1991– 2000). The results reveal that NSGA-II performs favourably well to locate Pareto optimal solutions in the parameters search space. Furthermore, identifiability analysis of the WetSpa model parameters shows that most parameters are well-identifiable.

abstract = {Numerical simulation models of forest ecosystems synthesize a broad
array of concepts from tree physiology, community ecology, hydrology,
soil physics, soil chemistry and soil microbiology. Most current models
are directed toward assessing natural processes or existing conditions,
nutrient losses influenced by atmospheric deposition, C and N dynamics
related to climate variation, and impacts of management activities. They
have been applied mostly at the stand or plot scale, but regional and
global applications are expanding. Commonly included belowground
processes are nutrient uptake by roots, root respiration, root growth
and death, microbial respiration, microbial mineralization and
immobilization of nutrients, nitrification, denitrification, water
transport, solute transport, cation exchange, anion sorption, mineral
weathering and solution equilibration. Models differ considerably with
respect to which processes and associated chemical forms are included,
and how environmental and other factors influence process rates. Recent
models demonstrated substantial discrepancies between model output and
observations for both model verification and validation. The normalized
mean absolute error between model output and observations of soil
solution solute concentrations, solid phase characteristics, and process
rates ranged from 0 to >1000%. There were considerable differences
among outputs from models applied to the same situation, with process
rates differing by as much as a factor of 4, and changes in chemical
masses differing in both direction and magnitude. These discrepancies
are attributed to differences in model structure, specific equations
relating process rates to environmental factors, calibration procedures,
and uncertainty of observations. Substantial improvement in the
capability of models to reproduce observed trends is required for models
to be generally applicable in public-policy decisions. Approaches that
may contribute to improvement include modularity to allow easy
alteration and comparison of individual equations and process
formulations; hierarchical structure to allow selection of level of
detail, depending on availability of data for calibration and driving
variables; enhanced documentation of all phases of model development,
calibration, and evaluation; and continued coordination with
experimental studies, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

@article{Wagner2015,
abstract = {I would like to thank Emerson et al. (2015) for providing a more formal description and clarification of spatial component regression (SCR). Indeed, their comment goes beyond the scope of the original paper and provides a much-needed analysis of the perfor-mance of constrained SCR, a variation of spatial filtering with spatial eigenvectors using Moran eigen-vector maps (MEM), in regression inference. The simulation results clearly show that spatial filtering, as implemented in Wagner (2013), does not control type I errors. While the original paper did not explicitly make such a claim, it did not explicitly warn that the behavior has not been thoroughly tested yet, hence Emerson et al. provide a timely warning. Previous studies testing spatial filtering methods with eigenvectors have reported conflicting results. For instance, Beale et al. (2010) found spatial filtering did not control type I error rates, whereas Peres-Neto and Legendre (2010) found that spatial filtering did control type I error rates. Clearly, more research is urgently needed to understand under which conditions spatial filtering effectively controls for type I error rates, and to what degree this performance depends on the definition of the spatial weights matrix. On the other hand, the goal of Wagner (2013) was not to advocate a fully developed, specific method, but to challenge present thinking: the main message being that spatial eigenvectors provide a partitioning of regression models whose potential has not been fully recognized yet because of the narrow focus on variation partitioning and spatial filtering. Rather than selecting a small set of spatial eigenvectors, we can gain new insights by examining the association of the data with the full set of spatial eigenvectors. Expressing the correlation r xy between two variables x and y as the product of two vectors r yV and r xV of correlations with a matrix of spatial eigenvectors V thus leads to interesting new avenues. Applications may include spectral randomiza-tion methods for irregularly spaced and multivariate data or the development of diagnostic tools for spatial regression analysis. Finally, spatial weights matrices that are not of full rank need further attention in MEM and SCR. These matrices will result in multiple zero eigenvalues (or close to zero), but dropping them will lead to a matrix V with eigenvectors V k that do not fulfill the equation R k r 2},

abstract = {A systematic review and harmonization of life cycle assessment (LCA)
literature of utility-scale wind power systems was performed to
determine the causes of and, where possible, reduce variability in
estimates of life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Screening of
approximately 240 LCAs of onshore and offshore systems yielded 72
references meeting minimum thresholds for quality, transparency, and
relevance. Of those, 49 references provided 126 estimates of life cycle
GHG emissions. Published estimates ranged from 1.7 to 81 grams
CO2-equivalent per kilowatt-hour (g CO2-eq/kWh), with median and
interquartile range (IQR) both at 12 g CO2-eq/kWh. After adjusting the
published estimates to use consistent gross system boundaries and values
for several important system parameters, the total range was reduced by
47% to 3.0 to 45 g CO2-eq/kWh and the IQR was reduced by 14% to 10 g
CO2-eq/kWh, while the median remained relatively constant (11 g
CO2-eq/kWh). Harmonization of capacity factor resulted in the largest
reduction in variability in life cycle GHG emission estimates. This
study concludes that the large number of previously published life cycle
GHG emission estimates of wind power systems and their tight
distribution suggest that new process-based LCAs of similar wind turbine
technologies are unlikely to differ greatly. However, additional
consequential LCAs would enhance the understanding of true life cycle
GHG emissions of wind power (e.g., changes to other generators
operations when wind electricity is added to the grid), although even
those are unlikely to fundamentally change the comparison of wind to
other electricity generation sources.},

abstract = {This study evaluates the consumption of coarse woody debris in various states of decay. Samples from a northern Idaho mixed-conifer forest were classified using three different classification methods, ignited with two different ignition methods and consumption was recorded. Intrinsic properties that change with decay were measured including carbon to nitrogen ratio, density, heat content, lignin content, moisture content and surface area-to-volume ratio. Consumption for logs in different stages of decay is reported with characterisation of wood properties. Results indicate very decayed coarse woody debris is likely to be consumed to a substantially greater degree than sound coarse woody debris given similar conditions. High consumption occurred in debris with low-density, high-lignin content and high gravimetric heat content; however, lignin content and density showed the highest correlation with consumption. The Maser classification method grouped very rotten logs with high consumption into decay class 4 and the remainder into class 3. Trends in consumption were similar regardless of ignition; however low-intensity long-duration ignition produced higher consumption values. Focus on physical properties is recommended for predictive purposes over any classification method. Logs of other species and in regions with different decomposition and combustion dynamics may display different property ranges and consumption results.},

abstract = {There is extensive literature on model validation and testing in ecosystem science. In spite of this solid foundation, a survey of the current literature reveals that the practice of mode validation and testing has not matured over the past twenty- five years. Few examples can be found that rigorously explain the rationale behind model formulation, the methods of parameter estimation, and the procedures for model testing. It is more common to find that the problems and pitfalls of validation and testing are poorly understood, inadequately executed, or entirely ignored. Among the reasons for this are the accelerating pace of technologies for model development has not been matched by the parallel development of methods for model analysis and testing; a trend in increased model complexity often requires the inclusion of critical variables that are unmeasured or unmeasurable (e.g., dispersal in population and metapopulation models); and the short duration of most research projects provides insufficient time and resources for adequate testing of model performance. These challenges are particularly daunting for models that are implemented spatially over large regions (e.g., landscape simulators). These difficulties are further exacerbated by the fact that no single method is suitable for testing all possible models and modeling objectives. Here we review a heuristic approach to model evaluation and present a general method for constructing informative model-data comparisons. Our premise is that models never work in their entirety (they always simplify reality to some extent), but even inadequate models can be used to effectively so long as their behavior is well understood. This approach builds a richer appreciation for how a model matches data and the circumstances under which the model performs best. This fuller understanding of model- data comparisons allows client users to choose cases where the model can be confidently or to take advantage of model bias to obtain conservative results. We believe that a generalized approach to a broad variety of models, including complex ecosystem simulators must be developed. There are pressing needs for formal research on model construction, evaluation, and testing that should be a high priority for all ecosystem scientists.},

abstract = {Recent advances in optimizing watershed model calibration have focused mainly on incorporating multiple objective measures of model performance and improving optimization algorithms. However, some parameters vary widely among different calibration locations. We present a watershed model calibration method that combines multi-objective optimization with averaging across multiple calibration sites. Model parameters were first estimated by multi-objective optimization at each calibration site, and then finalized by weighted averaging the parameter values across sites. The weight for each site was calculated from the prediction error at that site. The calibration framework was applied to estimate 16 hydrological and nutrient parameters of the General Watershed Loading Function (GWLF) watershed model at the Rhode River basin, in Maryland, United States of America. When calibrated to a single watershed, GWLF gave reasonable predictions for monthly streamflow (r2 = 0.71–0.78), monthly total nitrogen (TN) loads (r2 = 0.55–0.65), annual streamflow (r2 = 0.80–0.91), and annual TN loads (r2 = 0.67–0.86); but success for total phosphorus (TP) loads varied among watersheds (r2 = 0.41–0.68 for monthly TP loads and r2 = 0.47–0.79 for annual TP loads). In comparison to the single-site calibrations, the multi-site weighted average approach combined with multi-objective optimization reduced the relative cumulative error of predictions in validation watersheds by 3.5–7.4% for monthly streamflow, 3.2–6.3% for monthly TN loads, and 4.3–5.9% for monthly TP loads, respectively.},

abstract = {Wildland fire is a major concern in the wildland–urban interface (WUI), where human structures intermingle with wildland vegetation. Reducing wildfire risk in the WUI is more complicated than in wildland areas, owing to interactions between spatial patterns of housing and wildland fuels. Fuel treatments are commonly applied in wildlands surrounding WUI communities. Protecting the immediate surroundings of structures and building with fire-resistant materials might be more effective, but limited resources and uncooperative homeowners oftenmakethese impractical. Our question washowto allocate fuel treatments in theWUIunder these constraints.Wedeveloped an approach to allocate fuel breaks around individual or groups of structures to minimise total treatment area. Treatment units were ranked according to their housing density and fire risk.We tested this method in a Wisconsin landscape containing 3768 structures, and found that our treatment approach required considerably less area than alternatives (588 v. 1050 ha required to protect every structure independently). Our method may serve as a baseline for planning fuel treatments in WUI areas where it is impractical to protect every single house, or when fire-proofing is unfeasible. This approach is especially suitable in regions where spotting is a minor cause of home ignitions},

abstract = {Ecosystem modeling is confronted with complex biological systems and changing environmental conditions. A model which describes ecosystem behavior under all conditions has not been found yet and there does not exist one 'true' model for a specific ecosystem. Often ecosystem models describe the measured data more or less well, but most judging criteria for model performance are rather subjective. Furthermore, from a mathematical view point the calibrations of ecosystem models are hardly ever unique. The aim of this study was to develop and use criteria which permit an objective comparison of different models to the observed field data and to each other. A given model which describes a specific system significantly better will be declared the 'valid' model while the other will be rejected. The term 'valid' is used here in a sense that any model that could not be proven invalid would be a valid model for the system. We used the biogeochemical soil models MAGIC (Cosby, B.J., Hornberger, G.M., Wright, R.F., 1985. Modelling the effects of acid deposition: assessment of a lumped-parameter model of soil water and stream water chemistry. Water Resour. Res. 21, 51-63) and the SO-Model (derived from the Batch Equilibrium Model (BEM; Prenzel, J., 1991. Introduction to BEM (Batch Equilibrium Model), vol 28. Berichte des Forschungszentrums Waldokosysteme/Waldsterben, Gottingen, 51 pp.). The data set used was the soil solution chemistry in a forest ecosystem of the Soiling area (North-West Germany). To test the performance of the models four criteria were used: the efficiency (Martinec, J., Rango, A., 1989. Merits of statistical criteria for the performance of hydrologic models. Water Resour. Bull. 25 (2), 421-432; Hinzman, L.D., Kane, D.L., 1991. Snow hydrology of a headwater artic basin; 2. Conceptual analysis and computer modelling. Water Resour.

(Ed.), Modelling Water, Carbon and Nutrient Cycles in Forests: Application of 16 Simulation Models to a Spruce Stand at Soiling, Germany. Ecological Modelling, vol. 83, pp. 55-66), the confidence interval test (CIT, developed in this study) and the model rejection criteria (Sun, N.Z., 1994. Inverse Problems in Groundwater Modelling. Dordrecht, 337 pp.). Whereas the efficiency and NMAE are related to the averaged data, the CIT and the model rejection criteria include the spatial heterogeneity at every time step. When evaluated visually, both model results might be accepted. From the application of the model performance criteria we selected the MAGIC model as the 'valid' model for our system.},

abstract = {Scale invariant patterns have been observed in a range of terrestrial and marine ecosystems. These patterns are commonly interpreted as a signature of a self-organising system where global structures emerge from local dynamic interactions between system elements. In effect, an analogy is drawn to the scale invariant output of self-organised model systems, such as the Drossel and Schwabl forest fire model (FFM), and scale invariance in actual systems is then taken to be the product of self-organisation rather than some other process-specific, generative cause. Misinterpretation of the generative mechanism of scale invariance may well have significant consequences for ecosystem management. In actual ecosystems spatial interactions typically vary in form, distance and direction over time, often dependent on exogenous factors such as weather. While simulation models may sometimes represent spatial processes using a variable interaction within a local neighbourhood, what influence this has on model phenomena that are normally attributable to self-organisation has been little studied. We relax a key assumption implicit in the FFM by allowing different sized neighbourhoods over which contagion can occur, rather than maintain a constant sized neighbourhood. We examine how the scaling behaviour of simulated fire sizes changes with a variable neighbourhood size, and show that the invariant scaling typical of the FFM ‘breaks' with the relaxation of the neighbourhood assumption. Our findings are a strong indication that the generative origins of scale invariance in the FFM (i.e., selforganisation) and in actual fire-prone forest landscapes are essentially different, in contrast to conclusions of previous studies.},

abstract = {A broad-scale probabilistic model of forest fires, EMBYR, has been developed to simulate the effects of large fires burning through heterogeneous landscapes. Fire ignition and spread are simulated on a gridded landscape by (1) examining each burning site at each time step, (2) independently evaluating the probability of spread to eight neighbors based on fuel type, fuel moisture, wind speed and direction, and (3) distributing firebrands to downwind sites, where the probability of ignition of new fires is a function of fuel type and moisture conditions. Low values for the probability of spread, I, produce a dendritic burn pattern resembling a slow, meandering fire, whereas higher values of I produce solid patterns similar to a rapidly moving, intensely burning fire. I had to be greater than a critical value, i(c), estimated to lie between 0.250 and 0.251, to have a 50% chance of propagating across the landscape by adjacent spread alone. The rate of spread of fire at I = 0.30 was nearly four times faster when firebrands were included in the simulations, and nearly eight times faster in the presence of moderate wind. Given the importance of firebrands in projecting fire spread, there is a need for better empirical information on fire spotting. A set of model parameters was developed to represent the weather conditions and fuel types on the subalpine plateau of Yellowstone National Park, WY, USA. Simulation experiments were performed to reveal relationships between fire and landscape-scale heterogeneity of fuels. In addition, EMBYR was used to explore fire patterns in the subalpine plateau by simulating four scenarios of weather and fuel conditions. The results of repeated simulations were compared by evaluating risk (the cumulative frequency distribution of the area burned) as a function of the change in weather conditions. Estimates of risk summarized the high degree of variability experienced in natural systems, the difficulty of predicting fire behavior when conditions are near critical thresholds, a quantification of uncertainties concerning future weather conditions, and useful tool for assessing potential wildfire effects.

abstract = {Fire, in conjunction with landforms and climate, shapes the structure and function of forests throughout the Western United States, where millions of acres of forest lands contain accumulations of flammable fuel that are much higher than historical condi- tions owing to various forms of fire exclusion. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act mandates that public land managers assertively address this situation through active management of fuel and vegetation. This document synthesizes the relevant scientific knowledge that can assist fuel-treatment projects on national forests and other public lands and contribute to National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analyses and other assessments. It is intended to support science-based decisionmaking for fuel manage- ment in dry forests of the Western United States at the scale of forest stands (about 1 to 200 acres). It highlights ecological principles that need to be considered when man- aging forest fuel and vegetation for specific conditions related to forest structure and fire hazard. It also provides quantitative and qualitative guidelines for planning and implementing fuel treatments through various silvicultural prescriptions and surface- fuel treatments. Effective fuel treatments in forest stands with high fuel accumulations will typically require thinning to increase canopy base height, reduce canopy bulk density, reduce canopy continuity, and require a substantial reduction in surface fuel through prescribed fire or mechanical treatment or both. Long-term maintenance of desired fuel loadings and consideration of broader landscape patterns may improve the effectiveness of fuel treatments.},

abstract = {Abstract. A computer-based model of a small smouldering or creeping forest fire has been designed to simulate burned and burning areas of a fire at any time after ignition. The model assumes that a fire spreads in a grid whose squares are homogeneous fuel types. The arrangement of fuel types within each grid for a specific cover is determined by a probability distribution and a Monte Carlo sampling procedure. Rates-of-spread of fire in each fuel type vary with changes in fuel moisture. Persistence time of fire in each fuel type is considered. The minimum time required for the fire to reach any square in the fuel grid is determined by a dynamic programming algorithm. Rates of spread are allowed to vary during the life of the fire.},

abstract = {1. Animals foraging for resources are under a variety of selective pressures, and separate optimality models have been developed predicting the optimal reproductive strategies they should adopt. 2. In most cases, the proximate behavioural mechanisms adopted to achieve such optimality goals have been identified. This is the case, for example, for optimal patch time and sex allocation in insect parasitoids. However, behaviours modelled within this framework have mainly been studied separately, even though real animals have to optimize some behaviours simultaneously. 3. For this reason, it would be better if proximate behavioural rules were designed to attain several goals simultaneously. Despite their importance, such multi-objective proximate rules remain to be discovered. 4. Based on experiments on insect parasitoids that simultaneously examine their optimal patch time and sex allocation strategies, it is shown here that animals can adopt multi-objective behavioural mechanisms that appear consistent with the two optimal goals simultaneously. 5. Results of computer simulations demonstrate that these behavioural mechanisms are indeed consistent with optimal reproductive strategies and have thus been most likely selected over the course of the evolutionary time.},

abstract = {Fire planners and other resource managers need to examine a range of potential fuel and vegetation treatments to select options that will lead to desired outcomes for fire hazard and natural resource conditions. A new approach to this issue integrates concepts and tools from silviculture and fuel science to quantify outcomes for a large number of treatment options in dry forest stands in the western United States. Five silvicultural options (thinning from below to 50 trees per acre [tpa]; 100, 200, and 300 tpa; or no thinning) are considered in combination with three surface fuel treatments (pile and burn, prescribed fire, or no treatment), resulting in a range of alternative treatments for each representative stand. The Fire and Fuels Extension of the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FFE-FVS) was used to calculate (1) immediate effects of treatments on surface fuels, fire hazard, potential fire behavior, and forest structure (including visualizations); and (2) a 50-year time series of treatment effects at 10-year increments. These fuel treatment scenarios can be used as a starting point for examining alternatives for National Environmental Policy Act documents and other applications that require scientifically based information to quantify the effects of modifying forest structure and surface fuels. Forest managers also can develop customized treatments for specific locations and resource objectives. Scenarios and output can be used to inform ecological, economic, and sociological evaluations of the effects of fuel and vegetation treatments.},

Simulation studies that use certain fire modelling systems (i.e. NEXUS, FlamMap, FARSITE, FFE-FVS (Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator), Fuel Management Analyst (FMAPlus), BehavePlus) based on separate implementations or direct integration of Rothermel's surface and crown rate of fire spread models with Van Wagner's crown fire transition and propagation models are shown to have a significant underprediction bias when used in assessing potential crown fire behaviour in conifer forests of western North America. The principal sources of this underprediction bias are shown to include: (i) incompatible model linkages; (ii) use of surface and crown fire rate of spread models that have an inherent underprediction bias; and (iii) reduction in crown fire rate of spread based on the use of unsubstantiated crown fraction burned functions. The use of uncalibrated custom fuel models to represent surface fuelbeds is a fourth potential source of bias. These sources are described and documented in detail based on comparisons with experimental fire and wildfire observations and on separate analyses of model components. The manner in which the two primary canopy fuel inputs influencing crown fire initiation (i.e. foliar moisture content and canopy base height) is handled in these simulation studies and the meaning of Scott and Reinhardt's two crown fire hazard indices are also critically examined},

abstract = {Reiteration is the process whereby architectural units are replicated within a tree. Both immediate (from apical buds) and delayed (from suppressed or adventitious buds) reiteration can be seen in many tree species where architectural units ranging from clusters of shoots to entire branches and stems are replicated. In large old trees and suppressed trees, delayed reiteration occurs without an obvious external stimulus such as defoliation or traumatic loss of the branch apex. This suggests that, in trees that are growth-limited, reiteration is an adaptive mechanism for crown maintenance. We discuss theories about the aging process and how delayed adaptive reiteration may help maintain crown productivity and increase longevity. These include: (1) reducing the respiration/photosynthesis ratio; (2) increasing hydraulic conductance to newly developing foliage; (3) reducing nutrient loss from the tree; and (4) rejuvenating the apical meristem. The ability to reiterate various architectural units may contribute to increasing lifetime reproductive output by prolonging tree longevity. Further studies on the physiological and ecological implications of reiteration are needed to understand its adaptive significance in the life history of trees.},

abstract = {Because of the difficulty and time involved in making exhaustive measurements of the geometric parameters of large tree crowns, simplifying hypotheses are often used in 3D virtual plant modelling, but the effects on the radiation balance of each approximation are rarely assessed. Three hybrid walnut trees aged 7–9 years were digitized to analyse the effect of the crown geometric variables on light capture. The six studied variables were: (1) leaf area, (2) number of leaves per annual shoot, (3) position of leaves, (4) orientation of leaves, (5) leaflet inclination, and (6) lamina shape. For each variable, a sensitivity analysis compared a reference, based on observed values, with scenarios consisting of simplifying hypotheses. The total incident light intercepted during a bright day and the distributions of leaf irradiance were calculated using the Archimed radiative transfer model. Since some of the crown parameters were generated stochastically, the radiation simulations were repeated until results stabilised. Simplified models can be used to calculate with satisfactory results individual leaf area and number of leaves per shoot. Conversely, differentiating statistical distributions of individual leaf area between short and long shoots is more difficult and may generate errors up to 30%. Leaf clumping is a determining factor and requires correct grouping of leaves around the annual shoots bearing them. The effect of position of leaves along the shoot is less than 2%. Simple statistical distributions are adequate for representing leaf angle. Finally, the effect of specific leaf geometry is very important, but it can be approached using a limited number of representative leaf shapes.},

abstract = {We examined the effects of three early season (spring) prescribed fires on burn severity patterns of summer wildfires that occurred 1-3. years post-treatment in a mixed conifer forest in central Idaho. Wildfire and prescribed fire burn severities were estimated as the difference in normalized burn ratio (dNBR) using Landsat imagery. We used GIS derived vegetation, topography, and treatment variables to generate models predicting the wildfire burn severity of 1286-5500 30-m pixels within and around treated areas. We found that wildfire severity was significantly lower in treated areas than in untreated areas and significantly lower than the potential wildfire severity of the treated areas had treatments not been implemented. At the pixel level, wildfire severity was best predicted by an interaction between prescribed fire severity, topographic moisture, heat load, and pre-fire vegetation volume. Prescribed fire severity and vegetation volume were the most influential predictors. Prescribed fire severity, and its influence on wildfire severity, was highest in relatively warm and dry locations, which were able to burn under spring conditions. In contrast, wildfire severity peaked in cooler, more mesic locations that dried later in the summer and supported greater vegetation volume. We found considerable evidence that prescribed fires have landscape-level influences within treatment boundaries; most notable was an interaction between distance from the prescribed fire perimeter and distance from treated patch edges, which explained up to 66% of the variation in wildfire severity. Early season prescribed fires may not directly target the locations most at risk of high severity wildfire, but proximity of these areas to treated patches and the discontinuity of fuels following treatment may influence wildfire severity and explain how even low severity treatments can be effective management tools in fire-prone landscapes. ?? 2012.},

The Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FFE-FVS) is a model that predicts CBD and CBH. Currently, FFE-FVS accounts for neither geographic variation in tree allometries nor the nonuniform distribution of crown mass when one is estimating CBH and CBD. We develop allometric equations specific to ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) in the Black Hills to predict crown mass and use the Weibull distribution to model the vertical distribution of crown mass within individual trees. We present parameter prediction models that, in turn, predict the vertical distribution of crown mass based on stand- and tree-level attributes. With use of an FFE-FVS executable incorporating local crown mass equations and the parameter prediction models, new estimates of CBD and CBH were produced. Locally derived biomass equations predicted substantially greater estimates of foliage mass than currently predicted by FFE-FVS. The increase in CBD resulting from the local biomass and vertical distribution models averaged 78% over original estimates. Our results suggest that locally derived crown mass equations in addition to nonuniform estimates of crown mass distribution be used to calculate CBH and CBD as used in fire prediction models.},

abstract = {Techniques for modeling burn probability (BP) combine the stochastic components of fire regimes (ignitions and weather) with sophisticated fire growth algorithms to produce high-resolution spatial estimates of the relative likelihood of burning. Despite the numerous investigations of fire patterns from either observed or simulated sources, the specific influence of environmental factors on BP patterns is not well understood. This study examined the relative effects of ignitions, fuels, and weather on mean BP and spatial patterns in BP (i.e., BP variability) using highly simplified artificial landscapes and wildfire simulation methods. Our results showed that a limited set of inputs yielded a wide range of responses in the mean and spatial patterning of BP. The input factors contributed unequally to mean BP and to BP variability: so-called top-down controls (weather) primarily influenced mean BP, whereas bottom-up influences (ignitions and fuels) were mainly responsible for the spatial patterns of BP. However, confounding effects and interactions among factors suggest that fully separating top-down and bottom-up controls may be impossible. Furthermore, interactions among input variables produced unanticipated but explainable BP patterns, hinting at complex topological dependencies among the main determinants of fire spread and the resulting BP. The results will improve our understanding of the spatial ecology of fire regimes and help in the interpretation of patterns of fire likelihood on real landscapes as part of future wildfire risk assessments.},

abstract = {The Santa Fe municipal watershed provides up to 40% of the city's water and is at high risk of a standreplacing fire that could threaten the water resource and cause severe ecological damage. Restoration and crown fire hazard reduction in the ponderosa pine (PP) forest is in progress, but the historic role of crown fire in the mixed-conifer/aspen (MC) and spruce-dominated forests is unknown but necessary to guidemanagement here and in similar forests throughout the southwestern United States. The objective of our study was to use dendroecological techniques to reconstruct fire history and fire–climate relationships along an elevation, forest type, and fire regime gradient in the Santa Fe River watershed and provide historical ecological data to guide management. We combined systematic (gridded) sampling of forest age structure with targeted sampling of fire scars, tree-ring growth changes/injuries, and death dates to reconstruct fire occurrence and severity in the 7016 ha study area (elevation 2330–3650 m). Fire scars from 141 trees (at 41 plots) and age structure of 438 trees (from 26 transects) were used to reconstruct 110 unique fire years (1296–2008). The majority (79.0%) of fires burned during the late spring/early summer. Widespread fires that scarred more than 25% of the recording trees were more frequent in PP (mean fire interval (MFI)25% = 20.8 years) compared to theMCforest (31.6 years). Only 24% of the fires in PP were recorded in the MC forest, but these accounted for a large percent of all MC fires (69%). Fire occurrence was associated with anomalously wet (and usually El Nin˜o) years preceding anomalously dry (and usually La Nin˜a) years both in PP and in the MC forest. Fire in the MC occurred during more severe drought (mean summer Palmer Drought Severity Index; PDSI = 2.59), compared to the adjacent PP forest (PDSI = 1.03). The last fire in the spruce forest (1685) was largely stand-replacing (1200 ha, 93% of sampled area), recorded as fire scars at 68% of plots throughout the MC and PP forests, and burned during a severe, regional drought (PDSI = 6.92). The drought–fire relationship reconstructed in all forest types suggests that if droughts become more frequent and severe, as predicted, the probability of large, severe fire occurrence will increase.},

abstract = {The prevailing paradigm in the western U.S. is that the increase in stand-replacing wildfires in historically frequent-fire dry forests is due to unnatural fuel loads that have resulted from management activities including fire suppression, logging, and grazing, combined with more severe drought conditions and increasing temperatures. To counteract unnaturally high fuel loads, fuel reduction treatments which are designed to reduce fire hazard and improve overall ecosystem functioning have been increasing over the last decade. However, until recently much of what we knew about treatment effectiveness was based on modeling and predictive studies. Now, there are many examples of wildfires burning through both treated and untreated areas, and the effectiveness of treatments versus no action can be evaluated empirically. We carried out a systematic review to address the question: Are fuel treatments effective at achieving ecological and social (saving human lives and property) objectives? We found 56 studies addressing fuel treatment effectiveness in 8 states in the western US. There was general agreement that thin + burn treatments had positive effects in terms of reducing fire severity, tree mortality, and crown scorch. In contrast, burning or thinning alone had either less of an effect or none at all, compared to untreated sites. Most studies focused on carbon storage agreed that treatments do not necessarily store more carbon after wildfire, but result in less post-wildfire emissions and less carbon loss in a wildfire due to tree mortality. Understory responses are mixed across all treatments, and the response of other ecological attributes (e.g., soil, wildlife, water, insects) to treatment post-wildfire represents an important data gap; we provide a detailed agenda for future research. Overall, evidence is strong that thin + burn treatments meet the goal of reducing fire severity, and more research is needed to augment the few studies that indicate treatments protect human lives and property.},

These tests can be used both for lattice and nonlattice data. They are based on the evaluation of an effective sample size that takes into account the spatial structure. For positively autocorrelated processes, the effective sample size is reduced. A method for evaluating this reduction via an approximation of the variance of the correlation coefficient is developed. The performance of the tests is assessed by Monte Carlo simulations. The method is illustrated by examples from geographical epidemiology.},

abstract = {Data on the years in which fires burned, on fire frequency, and on intensity and areal extent of fires were gathered from 935 scars on 220 stumps of mixed conifer forest species in an 1800- ha study area in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. Before 1875, fires scarred clusters of living trees every 9 yr on west-facing slopes at Redwood Mountain and every 16 yr on east-facing slopes. Mean fire-free intervals between 1700 and 1875 varied by habitat phase from 5 yr in ponderosa pine on a dry ridge to 15-18 yr in more moist sites with white fir. For most 1-ha sites, the maximum time without fire was 14-28 yr. From 1700 to 1875, fires of various sizes were found every 2-3 yr somewhere in a given drainage (not necessarily the same site) and every 5-9 yr in 3- to 16-ha sites. This compares with fires every 8-18 yr in 1-ha clusters and every 11-39 yr on individual trees. Scar records of pre- 1700 fires suggest intervals fairly comparable to those from 1700 to 1875. Evidence of fires diminished greatly after Indian burning was eliminated in the early 1870's, and such fire records became almost nonexistent after 1900, when fire suppression became more effective. Most of the pre-1875 fires were small and of low intensity. Even the larger fires were usually confined to I slope or 1 drainage area. The short mean intervals between fires suggest that pre-1875 mixed conifer forests did not usually have heavy accumulations of litter or dense thickets of understory trees. Instead, small-acreage, low-intensity surface fires must have consumed accumulated litter at frequent intervals and at the same time killed most of the conifer regeneration which had become established since previous fires. Such frequent fires would have led to an intricate mosaic of age classes and vegetation subtypes which, in turn, insured that a subsequent fire would not burn large areas with great intensity. Intense fires which moved from crown to crown were absent in the study area for the past 400 to 2000 yr. If frequency of lightning ignition of fires over the past 50 yr is typical, ignitions by Indians must have augmented lightning-caused fires to yield the pre-1865 frequency of fires in the Sierra mixed conifer forest. Since 1900, the lack of frequent, low-intensity fires has resulted in a major increase in understory forest and fuels.},

abstract = {During the 21st century, climate-driven changes in fire regimes will be a key agent of change in forests of the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW). Understanding the response of forest carbon (C) dynamics to increases in fire will help quantify limits on the contribution of forest C storage to climate change mitigation and prioritize forest types for monitoring C storage and fire management to minimize C loss. In this study, we used projections of 21st century area burned to explore the consequences of changes in fire regimes on C dynamics in forests of Washington State. We used a novel empirical approach that takes advantage of chronosequences of C pools and fluxes and statistical properties of fire regimes to explore the effects of shifting age class distributions on C dynamics. Forests of the western Cascades are projected to be more sensitive to climate-driven increases in fire, and thus projected changes in C dynamics, than forests of the eastern Cascades. In the western Cascades, mean live biomass C is projected to decrease by 24-37%, and coarse woody debris (CWD) biomass C by 15-25% for the 2040s. Loss of live biomass C is projected to be lower for forests of the eastern Cascades and Okanogan Highlands (17-26%), and CWD biomass is projected to increase. Landscape mean net primary productivity is projected to increase in wet low-elevation forests of the western Cascades, but decrease elsewhere. These forests, and moist forests of the Okanogan Highlands, are projected to have the greatest percentage increases in consumption of live biomass. Percentage increases in consumption of CWD biomass are greater than 50% for all regions and up to four times greater than increases in consumption of live biomass. Carbon sequestration in PNW forests will be highly sensitive to increases in fire, suggesting a cautious approach to managing these forests for C sequestration to mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emissions.},

abstract = {1. Animals foraging for resources are under a variety of selective pressures, and separate optimality models have been developed predicting the optimal reproductive strategies they should adopt. 2. In most cases, the proximate behavioural mechanisms adopted to achieve such optimality goals have been identified. This is the case, for example, for optimal patch time and sex allocation in insect parasitoids. However, behaviours modelled within this framework have mainly been studied separately, even though real animals have to optimize some behaviours simultaneously. 3. For this reason, it would be better if proximate behavioural rules were designed to attain several goals simultaneously. Despite their importance, such multi-objective proximate rules remain to be discovered. 4. Based on experiments on insect parasitoids that simultaneously examine their optimal patch time and sex allocation strategies, it is shown here that animals can adopt multi-objective behavioural mechanisms that appear consistent with the two optimal goals simultaneously. 5. Results of computer simulations demonstrate that these behavioural mechanisms are indeed consistent with optimal reproductive strategies and have thus been most likely selected over the course of the evolutionary time.},

abstract = {A simulation system was developed to explore how fuel treatments placed in topologically random and optimal spatial patterns affect the growth and behaviour of large fires when implemented at different rates over the course of five decades. The system consisted of a forest and fuel dynamics simulation module (Forest Vegetation Simulator, FVS), logic for deriving fuel model dynamics from FVS output, a spatial fuel treatment optimisation program, and a spatial fire growth and behaviour model to evaluate the performance of the treatments in modifying large fire growth. Simulations were performed for three study areas: Sanders County in western Montana, the Stanislaus National Forest in California, and the Blue Mountains in south-eastern Washington. For different spatial treatment strategies, the results illustrated that the rate of fuel treatment (percentage of land area treated per decade) competes against the rates of fuel recovery to determine how fuel treatments contribute to multidecade cumulative impacts on the response variables. Using fuel treatment prescriptions that simulate thinning and prescribed burning, fuel treatment arrangements that are optimal in disrupting the growth of large fires require at least 1 to 2 %of the landscape to be treated each year. Randomly arranged units with the same treatment prescriptions require about twice that rate to produce the same fire growth reduction. The results also show that the topological fuel treatment optimisation tends to balance maintenance of previous units with treatment of new units. For example, with 2% landscape treatment annually, fewer than 5% of the units received three or more treatments in five decades with most being treated only once or twice and ∼35% remaining untreated after five decades.},

Yearly mean burn severity values (weighted by area), maximum burn severity metric values, mean area of burn, maximum burn area and total burn area were evaluated within 27 US National Vegetation Classification macrogroups. Time series assessments of burned area and severity were performed using Mann–Kendall tests. Burned area and severity varied by vegetation classification, but most vegetation groups showed no detectable change during the 1984–2010 period. Of the 27 analysed vegetation groups, trend analysis revealed burned area increased in eight, and burn severity has increased in seven. This study suggests that burned area and severity, as measured by the severity metric based on dNBR or RdNBR, have not changed substantially for most vegetation groups evaluated within CONUS.},

There are several major fuel description systems currently used in the United States, Canada and Australia, and this is a source of confusion for many in fire management. This paper (1) summarises the challenges of describing fuels, (2) contrasts approaches (association, classification and abstraction) for developing fuel description systems and (3) discusses possible future directions in wildland fuel description and science to transition to a universal fuel description system. Most discussion centres on surface fuel loadings as the primary descriptive characteristic.

abstract = {Fire suppression in many dry forest types has left a legacy of dense, homogeneous forests. Such landscapes have high water demands and fuel loads, and when burned can result in catastrophically large fires. These characteristics are undesirable in the face of projected warming and drying in the western US. Alternative forest and fire treatments based on managed wildfire---a regime in which fires are allowed to burn naturally and only suppressed under defined management conditions---offer a potential strategy to ameliorate the effects of fire suppression. Understanding the long-term effects of this strategy on vegetation, water, and forest resilience is increasingly important as the use of managed wildfire becomes more widely accepted. The Illilouette Creek Basin in Yosemite National Park has experienced 40 years of managed wildfire, reducing forest cover by 22{%}, and increasing meadow areas by 200{%} and shrublands by 24{%}. Statistical upscaling of 3300 soil moisture observations made since 2013 suggests that large increases in wetness occurred in sites where fire caused transitions from forests to dense meadows. The runoff ratio (ratio of annual runoff to precipitation) from the basin appears to be increasing or stable since 1973, compared to declines in runoff ratio for nearby, unburned watersheds. Managed wildfire appears to increase landscape heterogeneity, and likely improves resilience to disturbances, such as fire and drought, although more detailed analysis of fire effects on basin-scale hydrology is needed.},

abstract = {The ecological literature reveals considerable confusion about the meaning of validation in the context of simulation models. The confusion arises as much from semantic and philosophical considerations as from the selection of validation procedures. Validation is not a procedure for testing scientific theory or for certifying the 'truth' of current scientific understanding, nor is it a required activity of every modelling project. Validation means that a model is acceptable for its intended use because it meets specified performance requirements. Before validation is undertaken, (1) the purpose of the model, (2) the performance criteria, and (3) the model context must be specified. The validation process can be decomposed into several components: (1) operation, (2) theory, and (3) data. Important concepts needed to understand the model evaluation process are verification, calibration, validation, credibility, and qualification. These terms are defined in a limited technical sense applicable to the evaluation of simulation models, and not as general philosophical concepts. Different tests and standards are applied to the operational, theoretical, and data components. The operational and data components can be validated; the theoretical component cannot. The most common problem with ecological and environmental models is failure to state what the validation criteria are. Criteria must be explicitly stated because there are no universal standards for selecting what test procedures or criteria to use for validation. A test based on comparison of simulated versus observed data is generally included whenever possible. Because the objective and subjective components of validation are not mutually exclusive, disagreements over the meaning of validation can only be resolved by establishing a convention.},

We model ecosystem productivity, evapotranspiration, and summer streamflow under a range of temperature and precipitation scenarios using RHESSys, a spatially distributed model of carbon–water interactions. We examine the direct impacts of temperature and precipitation on vegetation productivity and impacts associated with higher water-use efficiency under elevated atmospheric CO2. Results suggest that for most climate scenarios, biomass in chaparral-dominated systems is likely to increase, leading to reductions in summer streamflow. However, within the range of GCM predictions, there are some scenarios in which vegetation may decrease, leading to higher summer streamflows. Changes due to increases in fire frequency will also impact summer streamflow but these will be small relative to changes due to vegetation productivity. Results suggest that monitoring vegetation responses to a changing climate should be a focus of climate change assessment for California MTEs},

abstract = {We investigate a recent proposal that invasive species display patterns of spatial "spread regulation" analogous to density-dependent regulation of population abundances. While invasive species do offer valuable tests of ecological theories about spatial spread, we argue that the statistical approach used in the study is not useful, and that the proposed definition of "spread regulation" is likely to be confusing. While concepts of negative feedbacks in spatial spread may be reasonable, the proposed definition of "spread regulation" encompasses accelerating, constant, or decelerating spread.. There is no compelling biological or practical reasoning to adopt such a definition. Moreover, we show that the statistical patterns (from time series of ratios of newly to recently invaded sites) proposed as evidence of spread regulation are predictable from basic diffusion models or other common models of constant spread with some stochasticity in dynamics and/or observations. Because such a wide range of processes would generate the observed patterns, no clear biological conclusions emerge from the proposed approach to spread analysis. When regarded in the context of the impacts and management of invasive species, the proposed regulation concept has the potential to create costly misunderstandings.},

of F. imbricata in response to fire using remote sensing, GIS and
dendrochronology techniques, at landscape scale. Two sites were
evaluated and one of them was affected by fire in the year 1999. The
digital processing images (using the NBR spectral index) and the
dendroecological analysis verified this. A fire, occurring in 1978, was
also detected by the analysis of F. imbricata growth rings. The
relation between F. imbricata shrubland dynamics and spatial

established in the study area.},

abstract = {Computer models are increasingly used to simulate and predict the behaviour of forest systems. Uncer- tainties in both parameter calibration and outputs co-exist in these models due to both the incomplete understanding of the system under simulation, and biased model structure. We used sensitivity analysis, including both screening and global variance-based methods, to explore these uncertainties. We applied these techniques to the widely used forest growth model Physiological Principles for Predicting Growth (3-PG2) using field data from 141 plots of Corymbia maculata and Eucalyptus cladocalyx in Australia. The screening method was used to select influential input parameters for the subsequent variance-based analysis and thereby reduce its computational cost. We assessed model outputs including biomass parti- tioning and water balance, and the sensitivities of the soil texture group, which includes 7 parameters. We also compared the screening and variance-based methods, and assessed the convergence of the variance- based method, and the change in sensitivities over time. Using these techniques, we quantified the relative sensitivities of each model output to each input parameter. The variance-based method exhibited good convergence and stable sensitivity rankings. The results indicated changes in input parameter sensitiv- ities over longer simulation periods. The variance-based global sensitivity analysis can be very effective in calibration and identification of important processes within forest models.},

abstract = {The model of competition for light presented here uses modular autonomy to incorporate plasticity in plant growth under competition. Once plants are characterized as composed of modules, then model structure for competition changes in a fundamental way. Interactions between the plant module and its local resource environment must be modeled rather than the traditionally viewed interactions between whole plants and their neighbors. We assume that a plant module interacts with its local resource environment regardless of whether this environment was altered by a neighbor or by the same plant. Two spatial processes are considered: resource acquisition and growth. The spatial pattern of resource acquisition by a module determines a growth and allocation pattern, e.g., the elongation of branches into a gap. The spatial structure of a module and its connection to the whole tree then determines the pattern of resource distribution and resource acquisition of the next time step. Plasticity of plant growth is incorporated by variation in both the efficiency of resource capture of modules and patterns of resource allocation for individuals of different canopy positions and results in individuals in the community having different spatial structures. The model simulates the three-dimensional development of tree crown structure over time. It is applied to the 30-yr development of a dense, spatially aggregated stand of Abies amabilis beginning with an initial pattern of seedlings. The importance of incorporation of plasticity is apparent when the model output is compared to observed height distribution and crown structure data. Simulations indicate that asymmetrical crown development, one form of plasticity, is advantageous to stand productivity and becomes more advantageous as the degree of spatial aggregation in the initial spacing of trees increases.},

Attempts at classifying uncertainty in ecology have, for the most part, focused exclusively on epistemic uncertainty. In this paper we classify uncertainty into two main categories: epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty in determinate facts) and linguistic uncertainty (uncertainty in language). We provide a classification of sources of uncertainty under the two main categories and demonstrate how each impacts on applications in ecology and conservation biology. In particular, we demonstrate the importance of recognizing the effect of linguistic uncertainty, in addition to epistemic uncertainty, in ecological applications. The significance to ecology and conservation biology of developing a clear understanding of the various types of uncertainty, how they arise and how they might best be dealt with is highlighted. Finally, we discuss the various general strategies for dealing with each type of uncertainty and offer suggestions for treating compounding uncertainty from a range of sources.},

abstract = {Regional rainfall runoff models are used to estimate the hydrological dynamics, the water balance, and the statistics of hydrological variables at ungauged sites. Most hydrological models are calibrated in order to get a good fit between observed and simulated variables. One or several objectives might be used for the calibration, and the modelling uncertainty is seen in at least two phenomena: (1) The surface defined by a objective function is often non-smooth, multi-modal and even discontinuous. (2) Different objectives prefer different parameter sets. The aim of this study is to obtain regional parameter sets for the Ecomag model applied to the Saone catchment, and to assess the modelling uncertainty based on the trade-offs between the Reff criterion for daily streamflows in different catchments. This aim was achieved by applying a multi-objective calibration method with streamflow data from seven catchments as the objectives. A Pareto-set with 2330 parameter values were obtained. The 2330 parameter sets were used to obtain envelopes for the simulated streamflow. The results show that all the parameters might be considered as sensitive to the output results, that the trade-off uncertainty between the different catchments is important, and that this uncertainty can only explain parts of the complex uncertainties in catchment modelling. There is a need for finding new concepts describing the complex uncertainties in catchment models operating on daily time step.},

In coast redwood forests, the role of fire is not well understood and scant literature exists on post-fire response, particularly in the southern part of the range. In order to better understand patterns of survival and recruitment following fire for coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens {[}lamb. ex D. Don] Endl.) and associated tree species, three sites in the Santa Cruz Mountains, California, USA, were sampled following wildfire. Randomly selected 10 m diameter plots were used to collect data on survivorship and post fire regeneration in order to analyze short-term responses including mortality, crown retention, basal sprouting, canopy regeneration, and seedling production. Results indicated that coast redwood had the lowest percent mortality (11.98 %) and highest mean canopy retention (43.10 %) of all species sampled, followed by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii {[}Mirb.] Franco) (25.54 %), tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus {[}Hook. & Arn.] Manos) (23.27 %), combined oak species (Quercus sp.) (6.67 %), and Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii Pursh) (4.13 %). In addition, associated species experienced higher survival rates when proximate to coast redwoods. Coast redwood trees also exhibited the highest canopy regeneration (53 %), the highest average density of basal sprouts (3.54 x 10(4) ha), and the greatest average number of seedlings, ranging from zero to 2.09 x 10(5) seedlings ha(-1). Overall, coast redwood appeared to have a balance of fire adaptive features, exceeding all associated species, which allow individual trees to withstand fire, while at the same time promoting recruitment following fire.},

abstract = {Large fires are a major disturbance in Canadian forests and exert significant effects on both the climate system and ecosystems. During the last century, extremely large fires accounted for the majority of Canadian burned area. By mak- ing an instaneous change over a vast area of ecosystems, extreme fires often have significant social, economic, and ecologi- cal consequences. Since extreme values of fire size always situate in the upper tail of a cumulative probability distribution, the mean and variance alone are not sufficient to fully characterize those extreme events. To characterize the large fire be- haviors in the upper tail, the authors in this study applied three extreme value distribution functions: (i) the generalized ex- treme value (GEV) distribution, (ii) the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD), and (iii) the GEV distribution with a Poisson point process (PP) representation to fit the Canadian historical fire data of the period 1959–2010. The analysis was con- ducted with the whole data set and different portions of the data set according to ignition sources (lightning-caused or hu- man-caused) and ecozone classification. It is found that (i) all three extreme statistical models perform well to characterize extreme fire events, but the GPD and PP models need extra care to fit the nonstationary fire data, (ii) anthropogenic and natural extreme fires have significantly different extreme statistics, and (iii) fires in different ecozones exhibit very different characteristics in the view of statistics. Further, estimated fire return levels are comparable with observations in terms of the magnitude and frequency of an extreme event. These statistics of extreme values provide valuable information for future quantification of large fire risks and forest management in the region.},

abstract = {Comparisons of model behaviors are an efficient way of understanding the differences amongst various models and thus providing guidance to model users for selecting suitable models for their own purposes. This study focuses on a comparison of the most commonly used fire spread algorithms used in scenario fire regime models. This paper provides an overview of fire regime modeling and describes a simulation model, Ecological Disturbance Model, as a simulation shell for such a comparison using the Fort A La Corne forest area in central Saskatchewan, Canada, as the study area. Simulation results suggested that for a fire scenario modeling approach, various fire spread algorithms such as DISPATCH, percolation, and cellular automata (CA) may not result in significant differences between user-defined and simulated fire frequencies; however, significant differences in simulated forest dynamics could result when using different fire spread algorithms. The simulation results from DISPATCH and CA are more similar than those from the percolation algorithm; however, the latter appeared to be a better representative of observed fire spread processes due to its underlying assumption of fire spread mechanisms. Simulation results also suggested that the fire spread algorithms that replicate four or eight direction fire spread in percolation and CAwill not make a significant difference in simulated fire regimes or forest dynamics. It is thus recommend that using simulation shells as a tool to take alternative assumptions or models into account to narrow down the uncertainty parameters and avoid the paradoxes in the modeling of natural resource management},

abstract = {We present a classification of duff, litter, fine woody debris, and logs that can be used to stratify a project area into sites with fuel loading that yield significantly different emissions and maximum soil surface temperature. Total particulate matter smaller than 2.5 $\mu$m in diameter and maximum soil surface temperature were simulated using the First Order Fire Effects Model. Simulation results were clustered into 10 Effects Groups using an agglomerative routine where each Effects Group defined a unique range of soil temperature and emissions. Classification tree analysis was used to estimate the critical duff, litter, fine woody debris, and log loadings associated with the soil temperature and emissions of each Effects Group. The resulting 21 fuel classes are called Fuel Loading Models and classified the study dataset with an $\sim$34% misclassification rate. The classification can be used to describe fuel loadings for a plot or stand, or as map units for mapping fuel loadings across large regions. The classification process can be used to develop finer-scale fuel classifications for specific regions or ecosystems.},
annote = {Lutes et al describe a classification of duff, litter, fine woody debris, and logs (common ground and surface fuel bed components) using fire effects model. This classification can be used to stratify an area into sites with fuel loadings that yield different emission and soil surface temperatures. Fuel beds are the physical stratification of fuel components and are defined by the individual fire models. Downed dead woody fuels are usually stratified by size classes and in this study; they define fine woody debris (FWD) as all dead and down woody material less than 7.6 cm diameter above 7.6 cm are called logs (there are five generic representations of log distribution). Lutes et al only included data if they were accompanied by a detailed description of their sampling protocols. Of the roughly eleven thousand plots (11'000) plots gathered from across the contiguous USA, the results of this study were based on 4046 plots. These plots are from forested sites. Lutes et al state that the data may not fully represent the entire range of fuel bed conditions. This study presents a generalized classification of fuel loads. The classification process presented in this study can be used to quantify any fire effects and can be used in our study.},

abstract = {P>All species are restricted in their distribution. Currently,
ecological models can only explain such limits if patches vary in
quality, leading to asymmetrical dispersal, or if genetic variation is
too low at the margins for adaptation. However, population genetic
models suggest that the increase in genetic variance resulting from
dispersal should allow adaptation to almost any ecological gradient.
Clearly therefore, these models miss something that prevents evolution
in natural populations. We developed an individual-based simulation to
explore stochastic effects in these models. At high carrying capacities,
our simulations largely agree with deterministic predictions. However,
when carrying capacity is low, the population fails to establish for a
wide range of parameter values where adaptation was expected from
previous models. Stochastic or transient effects appear critical around
the boundaries in parameter space between simulation behaviours.
Dispersal, gradient steepness, and population density emerge as key
factors determining adaptation on an ecological gradient.},

abstract = {Historical variability of fire regimes must be understood within the context of climatic and human drivers of disturbance occurring at multiple temporal scales. We describe the relationship between fire occurrence and interannual to decadal climatic variability (Palmer Drought Severity Index [PDSI], El Nino/Southern Oscillation [ENSO], and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation [PDO]) and explain how land use changes in the 20th century affected these relationships. We used 1701 fire-scarred trees collected in five study sites in central and eastern Washington State (USA) to investigate current year, lagged, and low frequency relationships between composite fire histories and PDSI, PDO, and ENSO (using the Southern Oscillation Index [SOI] as a measure of ENSO variability) using superposed epoch analysis and cross-spectral analysis. Fires tended to occur during dry summers and during the positive phase of. the PDO. Cross-spectral analysis indicates that percentage of trees scarred by fire and the PDO are spectrally coherent at 47 years, the approximate cycle of the PDO. Similarly, percentage scarred and ENSO are spectrally coherent at six years, the approximate cycle of ENSO. However, other results suggest that ENSO was only a weak driver of fire occurrence in the past three centuries. While drought and fire appear to be-tightly linked between 1700 and 1900, the relationship between drought and fire occurrence was disrupted during the 20th century as a result of land use changes. We suggest that long-term fire planning using the PDO may be possible in the Pacific Northwest, potentially allowing decadal-scale management of fire regimes, prescribed fire, and vegetation dynamics.},

abstract = {Forecasting diameter growth accurately is essential for long-term forest management. The large-tree diameter growth submodel for ponderosa pine in the Southwest Ponderosa Pine model type of the Central Rockies variant of the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) was evaluated using a long-term data set. Small trees were predicted least accurately, with a large proportion being overpredicted in long projections. Sensitivity analysis methods were used to assess how the model could be improved by ranking input variables in terms of their importance to model predictions. Based on these results, a new 10-year periodic diameter model was developed using regression techniques. Compared with the FVS model, the new model reduced both the short-term (10-year) prediction error by 0.18 in. and the overprediction bias and error propagation in the long-term (40-year) projection. The improvement of the new model is attributed to the addition of top height and quadratic mean diameter. These variables describe the vertical and horizontal distribution of the canopy and account for the effect of intertree competition for light and nutrients. Describing the stand structure comprehensively helped to more accurately assess the resource environment that affects tree productivity. Comprehensive measures of intertree competition were found to be more important in long-term projections.},

abstract = {Recognition and analysis of spatial autocorrelation has defined a new paradigm in ecology. Attention to spatial pattern can lead to insights that would have been otherwise overlooked, while ignoring space may lead to false conclusions about ecological relationships. We used Gaussian spatial autoregressive models, fit with widely available software, to examine breeding habitat relationships for three common Neotropical migrant songbirds in the southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee, USA. In preliminary models that ignored space, the abundance of all three species was correlated with both local- and landscape-scale habitat variables. These models were then modified to account for broadscale spatial trend (via trend surface analysis) and fine-scale autocorrelation (via an autoregressive spatial covariance matrix). Residuals from ordinary least squares regression models were autocorrelated, indicating that the assumption of independent errors was violated. In contrast, residuals from autoregressive models showed little spatial pattern, suggesting that these models were appropriate. The magnitude of habitat effects tended to decrease, and the relative importance of different habitat variables shifted when we incorporated broadscale and then fine-scale space into the analysis. The degree to which habitat effects changed when space was added to the models was roughly correlated with the amount of spatial structure in the habitat variables. Spatial pattern in the residuals from ordinary least squares models may result from failure to include or adequately measure autocorrelated habitat variables. In addition, contagious processes, such as conspecific attraction, may generate spatial patterns in species abundance that cannot be explained by habitat models. For our study species, spatial patterns in the ordinary least squares residuals suggest that a scale of 500–1000 m would be appropriate for investigating possible contagious processes.},

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis (SA) is a commonly used approach for identifying important parameters that dominate model behaviors. We use a newly developed software package, a Problem Solving environment for Uncertainty Analysis and Design Exploration (PSUADE), to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of ten widely used SA methods, including seven qualitative and three quantitative ones. All SA methods are tested using a variety of sampling techniques to screen out the most sensitive (i.e., important) parameters from the insensitive ones. The Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model, which has thirteen tunable parameters, is used for illustration. The South Branch Potomac River basin near Springfield, West Virginia in the U.S. is chosen as the study area. The key findings from this study are: (1) For qualitative SA methods, Correlation Analysis (CA), Regression Analysis (RA), and Gaussian Process (GP) screening methods are shown to be not effective in this example. Morris One-At-a-Time (MOAT) screening is the most efficient, needing only 280 samples to identify the most important parameters, but it is the least robust method. Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Delta Test (DT) and Sum-Of-Trees (SOT) screening methods need about 400-600 samples for the same purpose. Monte Carlo (MC), Orthogonal Array (OA) and Orthogonal Array based Latin Hypercube (OALH) are appropriate sampling techniques for them; (2) For quantitative SA methods, at least 2777 samples are needed for Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST) to identity parameter main effect. McKay method needs about 360 samples to evaluate the main effect, more than 1000 samples to assess the two-way interaction effect. OALH and LP$\tau$ (LPTAU) sampling techniques are more appropriate for McKay method. For the Sobol' method, the minimum samples needed are 1050 to compute the first-order and total sensitivity indices correctly. These comparisons show that qualitative SA methods are more efficient but less accurate and robust than quantitative ones. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Aim Spatial autocorrelation is a frequent phenomenon in ecological data and can affect estimates of model coefficients and inference from statistical models. Here, we test the performance of three different simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) model types (spatial error = SAR err , lagged = SAR lag and mixed = SAR mix ) and common ordinary least squares (OLS) regression when accounting for spatial autocorrelation in species distribution data using four artificial data sets with known (but different) spatial autocorrelation structures. Methods We evaluate the performance of SAR models by examining spatial patterns in model residuals (with correlograms and residual maps), by comparing model parameter estimates with true values, and by assessing their type I error control with calibration curves. We calculate a total of 3240 SAR models and illustrate how the best models [in terms of minimum residual spatial autocorrelation (minRSA), maximum model fit ( R 2 ), or Akaike information criterion (AIC)] can be identified using model selection procedures. Results Our study shows that the performance of SAR models depends on model specification (i.e. model type, neighbourhood distance, coding styles of spatial weights matrices) and on the kind of spatial autocorrelation present. SAR model parameter estimates might not be more precise than those from OLS regressions in all cases. SAR err models were the most reliable SAR models and performed well in all cases (independent of the kind of spatial autocorrelation induced and whether models were selected by minRSA, R 2 or AIC), whereas OLS, SAR lag and SAR mix models showed weak type I error control and/or unpredictable biases in parameter estimates. Main conclusions SAR err models are recommended for use when dealing with spatially autocorrelated species distribution data. SAR lag and SAR mix might not always give better estimates of model coefficients than OLS, and can thus generate bias. Other spatial modelling techniques should be assessed comprehensively to test their predictive performance and accuracy for biogeographical and macroecological research.},

abstract = {Modelling and experiments have suggested that spatial fuel treatment patterns can influence the movement of large fires. On simple theoretical landscapes consisting of two fuel types (treated and untreated), optimal patterns can be analytically derived that disrupt fire growth efficiently (i.e. with less area treated than random patterns). Although conceptually simple, the application of these theories to actual landscapes is made difficult by heterogeneity (fuels,weather, and topography). Here a computational method is described for heterogeneous landscapes that identifies efficient fuel treatment units and patterns for a selected fire weather scenario. The method requires input of two sets of spatial input data: (1) the current fuel conditions; and (2) the potential fuel conditions after a treatment is conducted (if treatment is permitted in a particular location). The contrast in fire spread rate between the two landscapes under the weather scenario conditions indicates where treatments are effective at delaying the growth of fires. Fire growth from the upwind edge of the landscape is then computed using a minimum travel time algorithm. This identifies major fire travel routes (areas needing treatment) and their intersections with the areas where treatments occurred and reduced the spread rate (opportunity for treatment). These zones of treatment ‘need and opportunity' are iteratively delineated by contiguous patches of raster cells up to a user-supplied constraint on percentage of land area to be treated. This algorithm is demonstrated for simple and for complex landscapes.},

Large trees contained more and larger reiterations, greater trunk, root mound, and organic soil volumes, and a higher incidence of Phellinus than smaller trees. Roots and ectomycorrhizas were abundant in aboveground soils on the trees, occurred at higher densities than those of the surrounding forest floor, and may be important in recycling mineral nutrients. Stem turnover and reiteration were associated with Phellinus heart rot and appeared to be cumulative over time, resulting in persistent, structurally complex trees of indeterminate lifespan. Dicymbe corymbosa provides a rare example of a tree species that exploits both persistence and recruitment niches, as it successfully recruits through mast fruiting.},

abstract = {Southwestern ponderosa pine forest ecosystems have become uncharacteristically dense as a result of intensive livestock grazing, logging, and fire exclusion, which have contributed to a buildup of fuels and increased vulnerability to high-severity, landscape-scale crown fires. In 2002, we implemented a replicated ecological restoration experiment to (1) quantify site-specific reference conditions, (2) analyze effects of elevation on forest structure, surface fuels, and canopy fuels, (3) test responses to three treatments: control, full treatment, and burn-only, and (4) evaluate effectiveness of treatments for restoring attributes to near historical reference conditions. Reconstructed reference conditions showed that basal area (BA) averaged 9.2m2ha-1 and tree density averaged 86.2treesha-1 across the site in 1880 prior to widespread fire exclusion, with the highest tree density values occurring at the two upper elevation sites. In 2002, prior to treatment, BA averaged 28.9m2ha-1 and density averaged 927.9treesha-1, representing three- and ten-fold increases, respectively, compared to 1880 values with a higher proportion of the increase coming from mesic species at higher elevations. By 2013 (5-years post-treatment), the full treatment showed BA was reduced by 52% compared to pre-treatment values from 31m2ha-1 to 15m2ha-1 and density was reduced by 85% from 998treesha-1 to 153treesha-1. In the burn-only treatment, BA increased by 6% from 27.5m2ha-1 to 29.1m2ha-1 although density was reduced by 25% from 837treesha-1 to 625treesha-1 between 2002 and 2013. Canopy fuels dynamics were similar to forest structure responses: low values prior to fire exclusion, a marked increase by the pre-treatment measurement, substantial reductions following thinning plus burning, and minor reductions following burn-only treatments. Post-treatment diameter distributions in the full treatment closely resembled reference conditions; minor reductions occurred in the lower diameter classes in the burn-only. Mortality of trees established before European settlement circa 1880 varied by treatment: 25% of presettlement trees alive in 2002 died by 2013 in the full treatment, 31% died in the burn-only treatment, and 15% died in the control. Of the treatments tested, the full treatment was the only one that rapidly shifted forest structure, diameter distributions, and canopy fuels values to levels near or within the historical reference conditions. Results from this study showed that managers will have to consider tradeoffs between alternative treatments in the context of climate-induced, landscape-scale forest fires.},

abstract = {Modeling has become an important tool in the study of ecological systems,as a scan of the table of con tents of a ny major eco l ogical journ a l makes abundantly clear. A number of books have recently been published that provide excellent advice on model construction, building, and use (e.g.,Gotelli 1995, Gurney and Nisbet 1998, Roughgarden 1998) and add to the classic literature on modeling ecological systems and their dynamics (e.g., Maynard Smith 1974, Nisbet and Gurney 1 9 8 2 ) . Unfortunately, however, little - if any - of this growing literature on ecological modeling addresses the motivation to model and the initial stages of the modeling process, information that beginning students would find useful. Fast computers and graphical software packages have removed much of the drudgery of creating models with a programming language and opened new avenues of model construction,use,and even misuse. There are many reasons why a student might want to consider modeling as a component of his or her education. Models provide an opportunity to explore ideas regarding ecological systems that it may not be possible to field-test for logistical, political, or financial reasons. Often, learning occurs from apparently st range results and unexpected surprises. The process of formulating an ecological model is extremely helpful for organizing one's thinking, bringing hidden assumptions to light, and identifying data needs. More and more,students want to "do something" with modeling but are not sure how to get started. The goals of this article are to outline issues concerning the value of ecological models and some possible motivations for modeling, and to provide an entry point to the established modeling literature so that those who are beginning to think about using models in their research can integrate modeling usefully.We therefore envision the typical reader to be an advanced undergraduate, a beginning graduate student, or a new modeler.We first consider some of the values of models and the motivation for modeling.We then discuss the steps involved in developing a model from an initial idea to something that is implemented on a computer, outlining some of the decisions that must be made along the way. Many excellent texts and journal articles deal with the technical details of models and model construction; we do not attempt to replace this literature, but rather try to make the reader aware of the issues that must be considered and point to some of the sources we have found particularly useful. We begin with the assumption that the reader has decided that he or she would like to "do something" with modeling as part of his or her research (Figure 1). It is important to recognize the difference between models and the modeling process. A model is a representation of a particular thing, idea, or condition. Models can be as simple as a verbal statement about a subject or two boxes connected by an arrow to represent some relationship. Alternatively, models can be extremely complex and detailed, such as a mathematical description of the pathways of nitrogen transformations within ecosystems. The modeling process is the series of steps taken to convert an idea first into a conceptual model and then into a quantitative m odel . Because part of what eco l ogists do is revise hypotheses and collect new data, the model and the view of nature that it represents often undergo many changes from the initial conception to what is deemed the final product. The discussion that follows is organized to consider issues in a sequence similar to what a new modeler would encounter. Because individuals' backgrounds differ, the sequence is not fixed.We map one possible route through the sorts of decisions that will most lik ely need to be considered; this course is derived from our individual experiences plus the collective knowledge of our reviewers. We begin with conceptual models because many people, even self-labeled nonmodelers, formulate conceptual models.},

abstract = {The small world network model is extended to study fire spread through forest fuels. The proposed model includes the short-range radiative and convective effects from the flame as well as the long-range "spotting" effect of firebrands. It uses a weighting procedure on network sites based on the characteristic times of thermal degradation and combustion of a flammable site. First the model is validated against nonspotting fire experiments in homogeneous media. It is then applied to heterogeneous media to illustrate its ability to provide realistic fire patterns. It is found that the concentration of flammable sites, p, is a good measure of local small world network properties. Front propagation exhibits two thresholds delimiting the spreading/nonspreading transition: the first corresponds to a geometric second-order phase transition line and is inversely proportional to the fire impact length, l(c), according to p(c)(rn) = 0.5(l)(c-1), and the second is a dynamic threshold resulting from the weighting procedure. The p-dependence of the fractal dimension of the burned area confirms the percolation transition line behavior. Second, firebrands are considered by introducing a characteristic spotting distance. For homogeneous systems, the effect of firebrands on spread rate and burned area is strengthened when the fire impact length decreases and the characteristic spotting distance increases. The head fire goes forward by jumps, especially for small values of the fire impact length. However, the development of spotfires can slow down the overall propagation process. For heterogeneous systems, spread rate and burned area are significantly reduced as the degree of disorder increases. The influence of firebrands then becomes weaker and smoother. The model underlines the existence of critical channels of the propagation cluster, allowing to stop the propagation of fire if they are cut off.

abstract = {The need to transfer information across a range of space–time scales (i.e. scaling) is coupled with the need to predict variables and processes of interest across landscapes (i.e. distributed simulation). Agricultural landscapes offer a unique set of problems and space–time data availability with the onset of satellite-based positioning and crop yield monitoring. The present study addresses quantification of the spatial variability of rainfed crop yield and near-surface soil water at farm field scales using two general methods: (1) geostatistical and fractal analyses; and (2) univariate linear regression using topographic attributes as explanatory variables. These methods are applied to 2 years of crop yield data from three fields in eastern Colorado, USA, and to soil-water content (depth-averaged over the top 30 cm) in one of these fields. Method 1 is useful for scaling each variable, and variogram shapes and their associated fractal dimensions of crop yield are related to those of topographic attributes. A new measure of fractal anisotropy is introduced and estimated from field data. Method 2 takes advantage of empirical and process knowledge of topographic controls on water movement and microenvironments. Topographic attributes, estimated from a digital elevation model at some scale (10 m by 10 m spacing here), help explain the spatial variability in crop yield. The topographic wetness index, for example, explained from 38 to 48% of the spatial variance in 1997 wheat yield. Soil water displays more random spatial variability, and its dynamic nature makes it difficult to predict in both space and time. Despite such variability, spatial structure is evident and can be approximated by simple fractals out to lag distances of about 450 m. In summary, these data and spatial analyses provide a basis and motivation for estimating the fractal behaviour, spatial statistics, and distributed patterns of crop yield from landscape topographic information},

abstract = {Modern technology makes it easy to show how forested landscapes might change with time but it remains difficult to estimate how sampling error affects landscape simulation results. To address this problem we used two methods to project the area in late-seral forest (LSF) structure for the same 6070 hectare (ha) study site over 30 years. The site was stratified into patches by using aerial photos and data were collected on sample plots within the stratum. Our two methods differed in how the initial forest conditions in unsampled patches were attributed. Using method 1, we randomly assigned empirical plot data from sampled patches to unsampled patches within the same stratum; with method 2 we bootstrapped the plot data to identify a probability distribution of LSF structure for a sampled patch and then randomly assigned these probabilities to unsampled patches within the same stratum. Both methods used an individual tree growth model to project changes in forest structure. In the first decade, the ‘assignment' method produced an estimate of 2489 ha of LSF structure, an amount lying at the upper tail of the projection interval created by using the bootstrapped or ‘probabilistic' method. The probabilistic method identified the variation in LSF structure within landscape stratum, the strata most likely to contribute to LSF structure, the projected mean area in LSF structure each decade, and the variation in hectares associated with the projections. Data maps from both methods, together with projection intervals from the probabilistic method, offer enhanced ways to communicate the potential variation in landscape simulation.},

abstract = {The study of animal foraging behaviour is of practical ecological importance, and exemplifies the wider scientific problem of optimizing search strategies. L{\'{e}}vy flights are random walks, the step lengths of which come from probability distributions with heavy power-law tails, such that clusters of short steps are connected by rare long steps. L{\'{e}}vy flights display fractal properties, have no typical scale, and occur in physical and chemical systems. An attempt to demonstrate their existence in a natural biological system presented evidence that wandering albatrosses perform L{\'{e}}vy flights when searching for prey on the ocean surface. This well known finding was followed by similar inferences about the search strategies of deer and bumblebees. These pioneering studies have triggered much theoretical work in physics (for example, refs 11, 12), as well as empirical ecological analyses regarding reindeer, microzooplankton, grey seals, spider monkeys and fishing boats. Here we analyse a new, high-resolution data set of wandering albatross flights, and find no evidence for L{\'{e}}vy flight behaviour. Instead we find that flight times are gamma distributed, with an exponential decay for the longest flights. We re-analyse the original albatross data using additional information, and conclude that the extremely long flights, essential for demonstrating L{\'{e}}vy flight behaviour, were spurious. Furthermore, we propose a widely applicable method to test for power-law distributions using likelihood and Akaike weights. We apply this to the four original deer and bumblebee data sets, finding that none exhibits evidence of L{\'{e}}vy flights, and that the original graphical approach is insufficient. Such a graphical approach has been adopted to conclude L{\'{e}}vy flight movement for other organisms, and to propose L{\'{e}}vy flight analysis as a potential real-time ecosystem monitoring tool. Our results question the strength of the empirical evidence for biological L{\'{e}}vy flights.},

abstract = {Fire is a primary mode of natural disturbance in the forests of the Pacific Northwest. Increased fuel loads following fire suppression and the occurrence of several large and severe fires have led to the perception that in many areas there is a greatly increased risk of high-severity fire compared with presettlement forests. To reconstruct the variability of the fire regime in the Siskiyou Mountains, Oregon, we analyzed a 10-m, 2,000-y sediment core for charcoal, pollen, and sedimentological data. The record reveals a highly episodic pattern of fire in which 77% of the 68 charcoal peaks before Euro-American settlement cluster within nine distinct periods marked by a 15-y mean interval. The 11 largest charcoal peaks are significantly related to decadal-scale drought periods and are followed by pulses of minerogenic sediment suggestive of rapid sediment delivery. After logging in the 1950s, sediment load was increased fourfold compared with that from the most severe presettlement fire. Less severe fires, marked by smaller charcoal peaks and no sediment pulses, are not correlated significantly with drought periods. Pollen indicators of closed forests are consistent with fire-free periods of sufficient length to maintain dense forest and indicate a fire-triggered switch to more open conditions during the Medieval Climatic Anomaly. Our results indicate that over millennia fire was more episodic than revealed by nearby shorter tree-ring records and that recent severe fires have precedents during earlier drought episodes but also that sediment loads resulting from logging and road building have no precedent in earlier fire events},

abstract = {Variance based methods have assessed themselves as versatile and effective among the various available techniques for sensitivity analysis of model output. Practitioners can in principle describe the sensitivity pattern of a model Y = f (X1, X2, . . . , Xk) with k uncertain input factors via a full decomposition of the variance V of Y into terms depending on the factors and their interactions. More often practitioners are satisfied with computing just k first order effects and k total effects, the latter describing synthetically interactions among input factors. In sensitivity analysis a key concern is the computational cost of the analysis, defined in terms of number of evaluations of f (X1, X2, . . . , Xk) needed to complete the analysis, as f (X1, X2, . . . , Xk) is often in the form of a numerical model which may take long processing time. While the computational cost is relatively cheap and weakly dependent on k for estimating first order effects, it remains expensive and strictly k-dependent for total effect indices. In the present note we compare existing and new practices for this index and offer recommendations on which to use},

different size classes of trees using multivariate Gibbs point processes

limitation of the traditional use of the Gibbs models allowing to
describe systems with non-symmetric interactions between different
objects. When analyzing interactions between neighbouring trees it is
natural to assume that the size of a tree determines its hierarchical
level: the largest trees are not influenced by any other trees than the
trees in the same size class, while trees in the other size classes are
influenced by the other trees in the same class as well as by all larger
trees. In this paper, we describe a wide range of Gibbs models with both
hierarchical and non-hierarchical interactions as well as a simulation
algorithm and a parameter estimation procedure for the hierarchical
models. We apply the hierarchical interaction model to the analysis of
forest data consisting of locations and diameters of tree stems. (C)

Land managers need innovative tools and information to describe the impacts of past and future human activities on ecosystem dynamics so that they can plan for and respond to the burgeoning issues related to land management and conservation. Field studies, while preferable and reliable, will be problematic to implement because of the large time and space scales involved. Therefore, landscape simulation modeling will play a more substantial role in wildland fire management as field studies become untenable and the pressing issues become more complex. This report details the design and algorithms of a complex, spatially explicit landscape fire and vegetation model called FireBGCv2. FireBGCv2 is a C++ computer program that incorporates several types of stand dynamics models into a spatially explicit landscape simulation platform. FireBGCv2 is intended as a research tool, but it can be employed in various land management applications providing sufficient expertise exists to parameterize and initialize the model. This report is divided into four parts. In the first section, the FireBGCv2 program is presented in detail with description of most algorithms and protocols. The next section describes how the model is initialized and parameterized and how the results can be interpreted. The third section demonstrates FireBGCv2 by showing output, including maps, graphs, and charts, for two contrasting simulation scenarios—fire regimes under current and future climate for a landscape in Glacier National Park, Montana, USA. The last section details the strengths and limitations of FireBGCv2. The FireBGCv2 code, sample input files, and sample output from this demonstration are available upon request. This report is not intended as a user's manual because the inherent complexity in FireBGCv2 makes it unwieldy and difficult to use without extensive training and experience in geographical analysis, simulation modeling, and data management.},

The origin of the critical behaviour is explained, critical exponents are introduced and scaling relations between the exponents are derived. Results of computer simulations and analytical calculations are summarized.

abstract = {Species distributional or trait data based on range map (extent-of-occurrence) or atlas survey data often display spatial autocorrelation, i.e. locations close to each other exhibit more similar values than those further apart. If this pattern remains present in the residuals of a statistical model based on such data, one of the key assumptions of standard statistical analyses, that residuals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), is violated. The violation of the assumption of i.i.d. residuals may bias parameter estimates and can increase type I error rates (falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect). While this is increasingly recognised by researchers analysing species distribution data, there is, to our knowledge, no comprehensive overview of the many available spatial statistical methods to take spatial autocorrelation into account in tests of statistical significance. Here, we describe six different statistical approaches to infer correlates of species' distributions, for both presence/absence (binary response) and species abundance data (poisson or normally distributed response), while accounting for spatial autocorrelation in model residuals: autocovariate regression; spatial eigenvector mapping; generalised least squares; (conditional and simultaneous) autoregressive models and generalised estimating equations. A comprehensive comparison of the relative merits of these methods is beyond the scope of this paper. To demonstrate each method's implementation, however, we undertook preliminary tests based on simulated data. These preliminary tests verified that most of the spatial modeling techniques we examined showed good type I error control and precise parameter estimates, at least when confronted with simplistic simulated data containing Ecography 30: 609!628, 2007 doi: 10.1111/j.2007.0906-7590.05171.x # 2007 The Authors.

However, we found that for presence/absence data the results and conclusions were very variable between the different methods. This is likely due to the low information content of binary maps. Also, in contrast with previous studies, we found that autocovariate methods consistently underestimated the effects of environmental controls of species distributions. Given their widespread use, in particular for the modelling of species presence/absence data (e.g. climate envelope models), we argue that this warrants further study and caution in their use. To aid other ecologists in making use of the methods described, code to implement them in freely available software is provided in an electronic appendix.},

abstract = {Growth, phenology, shoot morphology and water status of both newly exposed and unexposed understory Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis [Dougl.] Forbes) trees growing at 1200 m in the Washington Cascades were examined over a 3-year period. A transect was established in June 1981 perpendicular to the east-west edge of a clearcut made in February 1981. Trees from four plots along the transect were studied. Plots were from within the residual old-growth stand, on the inside edge, on the outside edge and well within the clearcut. The exposed plots were warmer, drier and brighter than the stand plots. Significant differences in water potential and leaf conductance were not observed and there were no apparent differences in the timing of bud burst between trees from the four plots. However, branch growth and shoot morphology (measured by Silhouette Area Ratio) were significantly altered. Foliage damage and leaf drop were three times higher in the center of the clearcut than along the edge of the clearcut. Photoinhibition, caused by sustained high light, appeared to be the major cause of this damage to the foliage. Although buds were preset under shady conditions, shoots emerging in the sun had a sun shoot morphology. Branch growth had fully recovered in exposed trees in 1982, and in 1983 both height and branch growth were increasing. Trees released by clearcutting in 1972, which had high rates of terminal growth in 1982, showed recovery patterns similar to the newly released study trees and thus provided a longer-term examination of the transition from shade to sun foliage morphology, crown structure and growth pattern. ?? 1987.},

Data from Pinus ponderosa and Pseudotsuga menziesii collected in 35 one-hectare plots over a 412-hectare study area were analyzed for the period between 1879 and 1947 using local spatial statistics and boundary detection techniques.Results of the analysis using local spatial statistic Moran's I showed significant clustering of boundaries near topographic breaks. To determine and test whether fire boundaries between plots were persistent, we used boundary detection methods and developed a spatially restricted randomization test. The results revealed that out of 86 possible boundary links, 8 were significantly persistent (P <0.025) while another 8 were significantly rare (P <0.025). These spatial methods can help determine the historical spatial configuration of persistent boundaries and can be used to maintain natural forest dynamics.},

abstract = {Concern about catastrophic tipping points has motivated inquiry to better understand ecosystem dynamics in the presence of human action. This requires that we confront multiple challenges in the evaluation of complex systems. One challenge is that resilience has proven difficult to quantify; another issue is that the value of model complexity relative to system complexity is disputed; and finally, local methods for assessing uncertainty are inadequate for more complex models. We address these three challenges simultaneously by proposing a means of evaluating ecological resilience via employment of global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis and comparing models of varying complexity. We suggest that probability distribution functions in output from global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis can be interpreted in terms of ball-and-cup diagrams used in systems theory to visualize ecological resilience. This permits quantification of ecological resilience in terms of the probability of whether a system will remain in a pre-existing state or shift to a different state. We outline the methods for using global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to evaluate ecological resilience and provide examples from recent research. We highlight applications of these methods to assessment of ecosystem management options in terms of their ramifications for ecological resilience.},

The FCCS summarizes and calculates wildland fuel characteristics, including fuel depth, loading, and surface area. Users may modify fuelbeds and thereby capture changing fuel conditions over time and (or) under different management prescriptions. Fuel loadings from four sample fuelbed pairs (i.e., pre- and post-prescribed fire) were calculated and compared by using FCCS to demonstrate the versatility of the system and how individual fuel components, such as shrubs, nonwoody fuels, woody fuels, and litter, can be calculated and summarized. The ability of FCCS to catalogue and summarize complex fuelbeds and reflect dynamic fuel conditions allows calculated results to be used in a variety of applications including surface and crown fire predictions, carbon assessments, and wildlife habitat management.},

abstract = {A forest is embedded in heterogeneous landscape mosaics and interacts
with the surrounding environment through processes such as seed
dispersal. Previous forest models, however, have either ignored such
interactions or made unrealistic assumptions. We developed a landscape
model (FORMOSAIC) that explicitly considers not only the dynamics of a
focal forest but also ecological impacts of adjacent areas on the focal
forest. FORMOSAIC is hierarchically structured, spatially explicit,
multi-scale, stochastic, and individual-based. It integrates information
of tree position, regeneration, growth, death, spatial interaction, and
environmental factors. Data for parameterizing FORMOSAIC were mainly
from a 50 ha permanent study plot in the Pasoh forest reserve
(Malaysia), which contained over 800 tree species and more than 330 000
trees with diameter at breast height (dbh) greater than or equal to 1.0
cm. Model simulation results agreed well with independent field census
data in terms of species richness, species composition, tree abundance,
and basal area at two spatial scales. Sensitivity analysis indicated
that minimum harvest size was the most sensitive parameter. Species
richness was particularly sensitive to the duration of seed immigration
from species-rich surrounding forests. For tree abundance and basal
area, the second most sensitive parameters varied at two spatial scales.
Through uncertainty analysis we found that many parameters had
scale-dependent and non-linear relationships with species richness, tree
abundance, and basal area. There also existed significant interactive
effects between parameters. The model could be a useful tool for
addressing important issues such as fragmentation and deforestation in
forest management for species diversity and timber production from a
landscape perspective. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Next, we review two broad categories of methods, focused on the spatial domain, for modeling potential range shifts and future suitable habitat: empirical species-distri- bution models and more process-based simulations. We propose long-term demography studies as a complementary approach in the time domain when sufficient data are available. Dispersal and successful migration into newly suitable habitat are key mech- anisms constraining range shifts. We review three approaches to estimating these processes, followed by a discussion of the potential for assisted migration.We conclude that there have been significant recent advances on several fronts but there are still large uncertainties that need further research.},

abstract = {For much of the world's forested area, the history of fire has significant implications for understanding forest dynamics over stand to regional scales. We analyzed temporal patterns of area burned at 25-year intervals over a 600-year period, using 10 tree-ring-based fire history studies located west of the crest of the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), USA, and related them to periods of possible influences of humans, climate, and stand development processes. An early period of widespread fire from the 1400s to ca. 1650 was followed by a period of reduced area burned from ca. 1650 to ca. 1800, possibly associated with cool climatic conditions. Fires were again widespread from ca. 1801 to ca. 1925, associated with European exploration and settlement and warm conditions. Fire suppression began ca. 1911, but appears to have been most effective in limiting the amount of area burned since ca. 1950. Anthropogenic change, climate, and the degree of stand/fuel development appear to have interacted in their influence upon temporal variation in fire regimes. Patterns of temporal variation in area burned were similar among the 10 studies, suggesting a regionally synchronous response. The roughly synchronous nature of fire in the region has important implications for our understanding of landscape dynamics under pre-settlement conditions. Forest landscapes of the Pacific Northwest may have exhibited high spatio-temporal variability even when large areas are considered. Major shifts in the landscape age class distribution were likely associated with episodic, high-severity disturbance events. Over certain time intervals in the past, particular seral stages of forest were either dominant across the region, or relatively scarce. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Given that resource managers rely on computer simulation models when it is difficult or expensive to obtain vital information directly, it is important to evaluate how well a particular model satisfies applications for which it is designed. The Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) is used widely for forest management in the US, and its scope and complexity continue to increase. This paper focuses on the accuracy of estimates made by the Fire and Fuels Extension (FFE-FVS) predictions through comparisons between model outputs and measured post-fire conditions for the Cold Springs wildfire and on the sensitivity of model outputs to weather, disease, and fuel inputs. For each set of projected, pre-fire stand conditions, a fire was simulated that approximated the actual conditions of the Cold Springs wildfire as recorded by local portable weather stations. We also simulated a fire using model default values. From the simulated post-fire conditions, values of tree mortality and fuel loads were obtained for comparison to post-fire, observed values. We designed eight scenarios to evaluate how model output changed with varying input values for three parameter sets of interest: fire weather, disease, and fuels. All of the tested model outputs displayed some sensitivity to alternative model inputs. Our results indicate that tree mortality and fuels were most sensitive to whether actual or default weather was used and least sensitive to whether or not disease data were included as model inputs. The performance of FFE-FVS for estimating total surface fuels was better for the scenarios using actual weather data than for the scenarios using default weather data. It was rare that the model could predict fine fuels or litter. Our results suggest that using site-specific information over model default values could significantly improve the accuracy of simulated values.},

abstract = {The crown architectures of 11 Psychotria species native to Barro Colorado Island, Panama were reconstructed from field measurements of leaf and branch geometry with the three-dimensional simulation model Y-plant. The objective was to assess the role of species differences in architecture in light capture and carbon gain in their natural understory environment. When species were grouped according to their putative light environment preference, the shade tolerant species were found to have a small but significantly higher efficiency of light capture for both diffuse and direct light as compared to the light demanding species. Within each grouping, however, there were few significant differences in light capture efficiency among species. The lower efficiencies of light demanding species was due to slightly higher self-shading and slightly lower angular efficiencies. Simulations of whole plant assimilation showed that light demanding species had greater daily assimilation in both direct and diffuse light due to the significantly greater light availability in the sites where light demanding species were found, as compared to those where shade tolerant species occurred. Among light demanding species, the above ground relative growth rate measured over a 1-year period by applying allometric equations for mass versus linear dimensions, was positively correlated with diffuse PFD and with mean daily assimilation estimated from Y-plant. For the shade tolerant plants, there was no significant correlation between RGR and mean daily assimilation or with any measure of light availability, probably because they occurred over a much narrower range of light environments. Overall, the results reveal a strong convergence in light capture efficiencies among the Psychotria species at lower values than previously observed in understory plants using similar approaches. Constraints imposed by other crown functions such as hydraulics and biomechanical support may place upper limits on light capture efficiency.},

basal area and the maximum development of the shrub stratum for species
located at intermediate elevations (Pinus nigra, Pinus sylvestris).
However, at the extremes of the elevation-climatic gradient (Pinus
halepensis and Pinus uncinata stands), stand basal area explained very
little of the shrub cover variation probably because microsite and
topographic factors override its effect. Among the Fagaceae species, a
negative relationship between basal area and the maximum development of
the shrub stratum was found in Quercus humilis and Fagus sylvatica
dominated stands but not in Quercus ilex. This can be due to the
particular canopy structure and management history of Q. ilex stands.
In conclusion, our study revealed a marked effect of the tree layer
composition and the environment on the relationship between the
development of the understory and overstory tree structure. More
fine-grained studies are needed to provide forest managers with more
detailed information about the relationship between these two forest
strata.},

abstract = {Wildland fuels are important to fire managers because they can be manipulated to achieve management goals, such as restoring ecosystems, decreasing fire intensity, minimizing plant mortality, and reducing erosion. However, it is difficult to accurately measure, describe, and map wildland fuels because of the great variability of wildland fuelbed properties over space and time. Few have quantified the scale of this variability across space to understand its effect on fire spread, burning intensity, and ecological effects. This study investigated the spatial variability of loading (biomass) across major surface and canopy fuel components in low elevation northern Rocky Mountain forest and rangeland ecosystems to determine the inherent scale of surface fuel and canopy fuel distributions. Biomass loadings (kg m super(-2)) were measured for seven surface fuel components-four downed dead woody fuel size classes (0-6 mm, 6-25 mm, 25-75 mm, and 75 + mm), duff plus litter, shrub, and herb-using a spatially nested plot sampling design within a 1 km super(2) square sampling grid installed at six sites in the northern US Rocky Mountains. Bulk density, biomass, and cover of the forest canopy were also measured for each plot in the grid. Surface fuel loadings were estimated using a combination of photoload and destructive collection methods at many distances within the grid. We quantified spatial variability of fuel component loading using spatial variograms, and found that each fuel component had its own inherent scale with fine fuels varying at scales of 1-5 m, coarse fuels at 10-150 m, and canopy fuels from 100 to 500 m. Using regression analyses, we computed a scaling factor of 4.6 m for fuel particle diameter (4.6 m increase in scale with each cm increase in particle diameter). Findings from this study can be used to design fuel sampling projects, classify fuelbeds, and map fuel characteristics, such as loading, to account for the inherent scale of fuel distributions to get more accurate fuel loading estimations.},

abstract = {Forest gap models are used widely in forest ecology, but their
complexity and stochasticity makes simulation studies rather demanding
even on modern computers, thus often precluding extensive simulation
studies. In this paper, a new method is proposed to efficiently estimate
the steady-state species composition of gap models. It is based on the
assumption that the stochastic process underlying gap models is weakly
stationary. Hence the average of one realization of the process over
time (i.e., model behaviour on one forest patch of 0.083 ha) is the same
as the average of the process across many patches in the steady state.
The new method is described in detail. Extensive simulation studies
conducted with the FORCLIM model suggest that the new method is much
more efficient for estimating the steady-state species composition,
requiring only 12.9% of the simulation time for the conventional
experiment of simulating the dynamics of many patches reliably.},

abstract = {Restoring characteristic fire regimes and forest structures are central objectives of many restoration and fuel reduction projects. Within-stand spatial pattern is a fundamental attribute of forest structure and influences many ecological processes and ecosystem functions. In this review we synthesize the available spatial reference information for fire-frequent pine and mixed-conifer forests in western North America; interpret this information in the context of restoration and fuel reduction treatment design; and identify areas for future research, including recommended approaches for quantifying within-stand tree spatial patterns. We identified 50 studies of tree spatial patterns in fire-frequent pine and mixed conifer forests, 25 of which documented spatial reference conditions. The characteristic structure of fire-frequent forests is a mosaic of three elements: openings, single trees, and clumps of trees with adjacent or interlocking crowns. This mosaic structure typically manifests at scales <0.4 ha, but sometimes extends to scales as large as 4 ha, particularly on sites with fire regimes that include both low- and moderate-severity fires. We documented preferential use of global pattern analysis techniques (90% of analyses) relative to local analysis techniques (10% of analyses). Ripley's K statistic, an example of global spatial pattern analysis, was the most frequently used analytic technique (38% of analyses). These findings are important because global pattern analysis does not explicitly quantify spatial heterogeneity within a pattern, the very thing spatial reference studies seek to characterize and one of the core structural attributes treatments aim to restore. Based on these findings, we encourage managers to consciously adopt a view of forest structure that accommodates spatial heterogeneity within forest stands, and to use this conceptualization of forest structure to guide prescription development. Restoration prescriptions and marking guidelines that explicitly incorporate within-stand spatial heterogeneity—such as by specifying the numbers and sizes of openings and tree clumps, and the number of widely-spaced single trees to retain per unit area—will improve the likelihood of restoring characteristic forest structures and the ecological processes such structures support. We infer that the near-exclusive use of global pattern analysis has limited the quantity and usability of spatial reference information available to managers, has also likely limited the development and testing of novel ecological hypotheses about pattern-generating mechanisms. Consequently, we recommend that forest scientists change how they quantify tree spatial patterns by complimenting the traditional global analysis methods with local pattern analysis techniques, which quantify spatial heterogeneity within a study area.},

abstract = {In this study, the overall utility of forest management alternatives at the forest management unit level is evaluated with regard to multi-purpose and multi-user settings by a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) method. The MCA is based on an additive utility model. The relative importance of partial objectives of forest management (carbon sequestration, ground water recharge, biodiversity, and timber production) is defined in cooperation with stakeholders. The forest growth model 4C (Forest Ecosystems in a Changing Environment) is used to simulate the impact of six forest management strategies and climate on forest functions. Two climate change scenarios represent uncertainties with regard to future climatic conditions. The study is based on actual forest conditions in the Kleinsee management unit in east Germany, which is dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and oak (Quercus robur L. and Quercus petraea Liebl.) stands. First, there is an analysis of the impact of climate and forest management on forest functions. Climate change increases carbon sequestration and income from timber production due to increased stand productivity. Secondly, the overall utility of the management strategies is compared under the priority settings of different stakeholder groups. From an ecological perspective, a conservation strategy would be preferable under all climate scenarios, but the business as usual management would also fit the expectations under the current climate due to high biodiversity and carbon sequestration in the forest ecosystem. In contrast, a forest manager in public-owned forests or a private forest owner would prefer a management strategy with an intermediate thinning intensity and a high share of pine stands to enhance income from timber production while maintaining the other forest functions.},

The identification of habitat variables associated to patch occupancy is particularly important when habitat quality is affected by human activities. Here, we analyze the influence of patch and landscape charac- teristics on patch occupancy by the subterranean herbivorous rodent Ctenomys porteousi. Patch occu- pancy was monitored in a network of 63 habitat patches identified by satellite imagery analysis which extends along almost the whole distributional range for C. porteousi. Suitable habitat for the occurrence of C. porteousi is highly fragmented and represents \10% of the total area in its distributional range. The distribution of C. porteousi in the patch network is affected not only by characteristics of the habitat patches, but also by those of the surrounding landscape matrix. Significant differences between occupied and empty patches were found in several environmental variables. Overall, occupied patches were larger, less vegetated, more connected, and had larger neighbor patches than empty patches. A stepwise procedure on a generalized linear model selected four habitat variables that explain patch occupancy in C. porteousi; it included the effects of habitat quality in the matrix surrounding the patch, average vegetation cover in the patch, minimum vegetation cover in the matrix surrounding the patch, and the area of the nearest neighbor patch. These results indicate that patch occupancy in C. porteousi is strongly influenced by the availability and quality of habitat both in the patch and in the surrounding landscape matrix.},

Risk is   defined using three probabilities: the probability of fire occurrence;   the conditional probability of a large fire given ignition; and the   unconditional probability of a large fire. The model is based on grouped   data at the 1 km(2)-day cell level. We fit a spatially and temporally   explicit non-parametric logistic regression to the grouped data. The   probability framework is particularly useful for assessing the utility   of explanatory variables, such as fire weather and danger indices for   predicting fire risk. The model may also be used to produce maps of   predicted probabilities and to estimate the total number of expected   fires, or large fires, in a given region and time period. As an example   we use historic data from the State of Oregon to study the significance   and the forms of relationships between some of the commonly used weather   and danger variables on the probabilities of fire. We also produce maps   of predicted probabilities for the State of Oregon. Graphs of monthly   total numbers of fires are also produced for a small region in Oregon,   as an example, and expected numbers are compared to actual numbers of   fires for the period 1989-1996. The fits appear to be reasonable;   however, the standard errors are large indicating the need for   additional weather or topographic variables.},

Leaf size and shape can also affect the efficiency with which the total photosynthetic surface can be arranged, supported, and supplied. Adaptations in leaf form thus touch on several aspects of plant form and function, with implications for thermoregulation (Gates et al., 1968), efficiency of water use (Pakhurst and Loucks, 1972), photosynthetic potential (Cunningham and Strain, 1969), branching and rooting strategies (Givnish and Vermeij, 1976), productivity (Tsunoda, 1972), and, presumably, competitive ability.},

We applied the model to an extended elevational gradient in the Colorado Front Range to test its ability to simulate vegetation composition and the strongly varying fire regime along the gradient. The simulated sequence of forest types along the gradient corresponded to the one observed, and the location of ecotones lay within the range of observed values. The model captured the range of observed fire rotations and reproduced realistic fire size distributions.

abstract = {To control and use wildland fires safely and effectively depends on creditable assessments of fire potential, including the propensity for crowning in conifer forests. Simulation studies that use certain fire modelling systems (i.e. NEXUS, FlamMap, FARSITE, FFE-FVS (Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator), Fuel Manage- ment Analyst (FMAPlus), BehavePlus) based on separate implementations or direct integration of Rothermel's surface and crown rate of fire spread models with Van Wagner's crown fire transition and propagation models are shown to have a significant underprediction bias when used in assessing potential crown fire behaviour in conifer forests of western North America. The principal sources of this underprediction bias are shown to include: (i) incompatible model linkages; (ii) use of surface and crown fire rate of spread models that have an inherent underprediction bias; and (iii) reduction in crown fire rate of spread based on the use of unsubstantiated crown fraction burned functions. The use of uncalibrated custom fuel models to represent surface fuelbeds is a fourth potential source of bias. These sources are described and documented in detail based on comparisons with experimental fire and wildfire observations and on separate analyses of model components. The manner in which the two primary canopy fuel inputs influencing crown fire initiation (i.e. foliar moisture content and canopy base height) is handled in these simulation studies and the meaning of Scott and Reinhardt's two crown fire hazard indices are also critically examined},

The studies were conducted at four locations in northwestern Wyoming, western Montana, and northern Idaho. Most distributions were strongly skewed to the right. Ratios of medians-to means for the fuel components by vegetation type and location all averaged close to 0.6 except for shrubs, which averaged 0.18. Correlation coefficients for fuel component pairs were mostly less than 0.30. Fuel loadings and predicted fire behavior varied considerably within cover types and fire groups compared to between vegetation types. Results suggest that a few models of physcial fuel properties for rating fire danger and predicting fire behavior by broad vegetation types are appropriate for practical applications. Other implications to predicting fire behavior using mathematical models are discussed.},

abstract = {This state-of-knowledge review examines some of the underlying assumptions and limitations associated with the inter-relationships among four widely used descriptors of surface fire behaviour and post-fire impacts in wildland fire science and management, namely Byram's fireline intensity, flame length, stem-bark char height and crown scorch height. More specifically, the following topical areas are critically examined based on a comprehensive review of the pertinent literature: (i) estimating fireline intensity from flame length; (ii) substituting flame length for fireline intensity in Van Wagner's crown fire initiation model; (iii) the validity of linkages between the Rothermel surface fire behaviour and Van Wagner's crown scorch height models; (iv) estimating flame height from post-fire observations of stem-bark char height; and (v) estimating fireline intensity from post-fire observations of crown scorch height. There has been an overwhelming tendency within the wildland fire community to regard Byram's flame length–fireline intensity and Van Wagner's crown scorch height–fireline intensity models as universal in nature. However, research has subsequently shown that such linkages among fire behaviour and post-fire impact characteristics are in fact strongly influenced by fuelbed structure, thereby necessitating consideration of fuel complex specific-type models of such relationships.},

abstract = {In 1993, a group of national forest stakeholders, the Quincy Library Group, crafted a proposal that intended to reduce wildﬁre risk, protect the California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis), restore watersheds, and enhance community stability by ensuring a predictable supply of timber for area sawmills and biomass for energy plants. The Herger-Feinstein Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery Act of 1998 codiﬁed this proposal, directing the USDA Forest Service to conduct forest treatments on 40,000–60,000 acres per year by creating defensible fuel proﬁle zones and logging by group- and individual tree-selection methods. The law also designated an Independent Science Panel to review monitoring studies, administrative studies, and research to assess efﬁcacy of the implementation and achievement of goals. Although several goals were achieved, implementation fell short of treatment and volume goals, and evidence was lacking to make conclusive judgments about environmental impacts. Shortcomings were due to differing interpretations of the Act's prescriptive intent, changes in management direction, compounding economic factors, appeals and litigation, variation in site-speciﬁc forest conditions, and variation in approaches among national forests and districts. Most notable was a lack of monitoring of the treatment effects on California spotted owl populations and other environmental concerns. These ﬁndings suggest that attempts to legislate prescriptive, collaboratively developed proposals may not account for the complex biophysical, management, social, and economic contexts within which national forest management occurs. These ﬁndings also suggest that current national forest policies and directives promoting collaboration should also be accompanied by a commitment to monitoring and adaptive management.},

abstract = {Abstract Landscape fragmentation is a well-recognized threat to the long-term survivability of many plant and animal species. As a complex concept, fragmentation has multiple spatial and functional components, of which spatial contiguity is of great importance. A contiguous landscape provides physical condition and increases the opportunities for species dispersal and migration. However, in real planning situations, contiguity is either too expensive to achieve or impractical because of barriers of urban landscapes. As such, the traditional yes/no function of contiguity has been extended into a notion of relative contiguity which has the value range between zero and one. Relative contiguity measures levels of interconnectivity of landscapes based on graph theory and spatial interaction. It takes into account both inner-reserve relationship (i.e. reserve sizes) and inter-reserve spatial proximity. This paper presents a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm approach to maximizing relative contiguity in reserve network design. This approach obtains solutions that maximize the measure of relative contiguity, minimize the total acquisition area, and satisfy constraints on the coverage of individual species. Application results show the developed algorithm has significant advantages in optimizing relative contiguity and generating a variety of alternative solutions.},

abstract = {Neutral landscape models, derived from percolation theory in the field of landscape ecology, are grid-based maps in which complex habitat distributions are generated by random or fractal algorithms. This grid-based representation of landscape structure is compatible with the raster-based format of geographical information systems (GIS), which facilitates comparisons between theoretical and real landscapes. Neutral landscape models permit the identification of critical thresholds in connectivity, which can be used to predict when landscapes will become fragmented. The coupling of neutral landscape models with generalized population models, such as metapopulation theory, provides a null modelfor generating predictions about population dynamics in fragmented landscapes. Neutral landscape models can contribute to the following applications in conservation: (1) incorporation of complex spatial patterns in (meta)population models; (2) identification of species' perceptions of landscape structure; (3) determination of landscape connectivity; (4) evaluation of the consequences of habitatfragmentation for population subdivision; (5) identification of the domain of metapopulation dynamics; (6) prediction of the occurrence of extinction thresholds; (7) determination of the genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation; and (8) reserve design and ecosystem management. This generalized, spatially explicit framework bridges the gap between spatially implicit, patch-based models and spatially realistic GIS applications which are usually parameterized for a single species in a specific landscape. Development of a generalized, spatially explicit framework is essential in conservation biology because we will not be able to develop individual models for every species of management concern.},

abstract = {Variations in vertical and horizontal forest structure are often difficult to quantify as field-based methods are labour intensive and passive optical remote sensing techniques are limited in their capacity to distinguish structural changes occurring below the top of the canopy. In this study the capacity of small footprint (0.19 cm), discrete return, densely spaced (0.7 hits/m–2), multiple return, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology, to measure foliage height and to estimate several stand and canopy structure attributes is investigated. The study focused on six Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii spp. menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] and western hemlock [Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.] stands located on the east coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, with each stand representing a different structural stage of stand development for forests within this biogeoclimatic zone. Tree height, crown dimensions, cover, and vertical foliage distributions were measured in 20 m {\textperiodcentered} 20 m plots and correlated to the LiDAR data. Foliage profiles were then fitted, using the Weibull probability density function, to the field measured crown dimensions, vertical foliage density distributions and the LiDAR data at each plot. A modified canopy volume approach, based on methods developed for full waveform LiDAR observations, was developed and used to examine the vertical and horizontal variation in stand structure. Results indicate that measured stand attributes such as mean stand height, and basal area were significantly correlated with LiDAR estimates (r2 = 0.85, P < 0.001, SE = 1.8 m and r2 = 0.65, P < 0.05, SE = 14.8 m2 ha–1, respectively). Significant relationships were also found between the LiDAR data and the field estimated vertical foliage profiles indicating that models of vertical foliage distribution may be robust and transferable between both field and LiDAR datasets. This study demonstrates that small footprint, discrete return, LiDAR observations can provide quantitative information on stand and tree height, as well as information on foliage profiles, which can be successfully modelled, providing detailed descriptions of canopy structure.},

abstract = {Wildland fuelbed characteristics are temporally and spatially complex and can vary widely across regions. To capture this variability, we designed the Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS), a national system to create fuelbeds and classify those fuelbeds for their capacity to support fire and consume fuels. This paper describes the structure of the fuelbeds internal to FCCS. Fuelbeds are considered relatively homogeneous units on the landscape, representing distinct combustion environments that determine potential fire behaviour and effects. The FCCS fuelbeds are organized into six strata: canopy, shrubs, nonwoody fuels, woody fuels, litter-lichen-moss, and ground fuels. Fuelbeds are described by several qualitative and quantitative physical and biological variables with emphasis on characteristics useful for fuels management and fire behaviour planning. The FCCS includes 216 fuelbeds that represent the major vegetation types of the United States. The FCCS fuelbeds can be used as presented or modified to create customized fuelbeds with general or site-specific data to address fire science management or research questions. This system allows resource managers to evaluate wildland fuels operations and management activities, fire hazard, and ecological and air quality impacts at small and large spatial scales. The FCCS fuelbeds represent the United States, although the system has the potential for building fuelbeds for international application.},

In seven pairs of treated{\^{a}}€“untreated study sites measured 2 years after the fire, thinning was strongly associated with reduced burn severity. Treated areas had more live trees, greater survival, and reduced fire intensity as indicated by crown base height and bole char. Ponderosa pine regeneration was patchy but more dense in treated areas. We assessed decade- to century-long effects of the pre-wildfire fuel treatments using the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS). Differences between treated and untreated areas were projected to persist for several decades after the fire in terms of stand structure characteristics and for at least 100 years in terms of species composition, with ponderosa pine making up $\sim$60% of basal area in treated areas but only 35% in untreated areas. Future ecosystem development may take the trajectory of recovery to a ponderosa pine/Gambel oak forest or of a shift to an alternative stable state such as an oak-dominated shrubfield, with untreated areas more apt to undergo a shift to a shrubfield state.

This is done by using a model which modifies the delta-distribution approach to fit into the GLM framework and uses maximum likelihood to estimate parameters. No prior assumptions of homogeneity are used for the structure of the zero or non-zero values. The method is primarily applicable to fixed-station designs, although extensions to other designs are possible. The maximum likelihood estimation reduces to fitting a GLM to 0/1 values and another GLM to the positive abundance values. The new model is tested on Icelandic groundfish survey data. It is seen that the model can be used for evaluating the effect of different factors on catch rates as well as estimating abundance indices.

abstract = {The arrangement of trees within a stand by location and age (stand structure) is in part determined by the life history strategy of the species and the disturbance history of the stand. In western North America such disturbances are often the product of wildfires and human management activities. The current study uses spatial analysis to characterize three stands of Pinus torreyana with known disturbance histories. Two stands are located at Torrey Pines State Reserve (TPSR). Of these, one stand has burned twice since 1972. Fire has been successfully excluded from the other stand since the early part of this century. A third stand, on Santa Rosa Island, Channel Islands National Park (SRI), has been grazed heavily since the mid-19th century and has not experienced fire since that time. One-hectare study plots were established in the interior of each stand. Considering the known life history attributes of P. torreyana, and the disturbance histories of the stands, predictions are made concerning the spatial characteristics of the respective stands. All trees within each study plot were sized by diameter breast height (DBH) and mapped. Three techniques of spatial analysis are applied to the resulting unweighted point pattern distributions and the distributions weighted by the square root of DBH as a surrogate for age. The results are consistent with predictions and confirm the following generalizations concerning patterns of aggregation in Torrey pine stands. Young trees tend to be more aggregated than old trees within the same stands. Young stands tend to be more aggregated than old stands on otherwise ecologically similar sites. On a periodically disturbed site there are clusters of trees that represent cohorts of post-disturbance recruitment.},

abstract = {Fire largely determined the composition and structure of the presettlement vegetation of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area as well as the vegetation mosaic on the landscape and the habitat patterns for wildlife. It also influenced nutrient cycles, and energy pathways, and helped maintain the diversity, porductivity, and long-term stability of the ecosystem. Thus the whole ecosystem was fire-dependent. At least some overstory elements in virtually all forest stands still date from regeneration that followed one or more fires since 1595 A.D. The average interval between significant fire years was about 4 yr in presettlement times, but shortened to 2 yr from 1868 to 1910 during settlement. However, 83% of the area burned before the beginning of suppression programs resulted from just nine fire periods: 1894, 1875, 1863-4, 1824, 1801, 1755-9, 1727, 1692, 1681. The average interval between these major fire years was 26 yr. Most present virgin forests date from regeneration that followed fires in these years. Significant areas were also regenerated by fires in 1903, 1910, 1936, and 1971. Most major fire years occurred during prolonged summer droughts of subcontinental extent, such as those of 1864, 1910, and 1936. Many fires were man-caused, but lightning ignitions were also common. Lightning alone is probably a sufficient source of ignitions to guarantee that older stands burned before attaining climax. Dry matter accumulations, spruce budworm outbreaks, blowdowns, and other interactions related to time since fire increase the probability that old stands will burn. Vegetation patterns on the landscape were influenced by such natural firebreaks as lakes, streams, wetlands, andmoist slopes. Red and white pine are most common on islands, and to the east, northeast, or southeast of such firebreaks. Jack pine, aspen-birch, and sprout hardwood forests are most common on large uplands distant from or west of such firebreaks. A Natural Fire Rotation of about 100 yr prevailed in presettlement times, but many red and white pine stands remained largely intact for 150-350 yr, and some jack pine and aspen-birch forests probably burned at intervals of 50 yr or less. There is paleoecological evidence that fire was an ecosystem factor before European man arrived, and even before early man migrated to North America. Probably few areas ever attained the postulated fir-spruce-cedar-birch climax in postglacial times. To understand the dynamics of fire-dependent ecosystems fire must be studied as an integral part of the system. The search for stable communities that might develop without fire is futile and avoids the real challenge of understanding nature on her own terms. To restore the natural ecosystem of the Canoe Area fire should soon be reintroduced through a program of prescribed fires and monitored lightning fires. Failing this, major unnatural, perhaps unpredictable, changes in the ecosystem will occur.},

abstract = {Each modeller who builds and analyses an individual-based model learns of course a great deal, but what has ecology as a whole learned from the individual-based models published during the last decade? Answering this question proves extremely difficult as there is no common motivation behind individual-based models. The distinction is introduced between 'pragmatic' motivation, which uses the individual-based approach as a tool without any reference to the theoretical issues which have emerged from the classical state variable approach and 'paradigmatic' motivation, which explicitly refers to theoretical ecology. A mini-review of 50 individual-based animal population models shows that the majority are driven by pragmatic motivation. Most models are very complex and special techniques to cope with this complexity during their analysis are only occasionally applied. It is suggested that in order to orient individual-based modelling more towards general theoretical issues, we need increased explicit reference to theoretical ecology and an advanced strategy for building and analysing individual-based models. To this end, a heuristic list of rules is presented which may help us to advance the practice of individual-based modelling and to learn more general lessons from individual-based modelling in the future than we have during the last decade. The main ideas behind these rules are as follows: (1) Individual-based models usually make more realistic assumptions than state variable models, but it should not be forgotten that the aim of individual-based modelling is not 'realism' but modelling. (2) The individual-based approach is a bottom-up approach which starts with the 'parts' (i.e. individuals) of a system (i.e. population) and then tries to understand how the system's properties emerge from the interaction among these parts. However, bottom-up approaches alone will never lead to theories at the systems level. State variable or top-down approaches are needed to provide an appropriate integrated view, i.e. the relevant questions at the population level.},

abstract = {Sea-level rise is expected to dramatically alter low-lying coastal and intertidal areas, which provide important habitat for shoreline-dependent species. The Snowy Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) is a threatened shorebird that relies on Florida Gulf Coast sandy beaches for nesting and breeding. Selecting a management strategy for the conservation of this species under sea-level rise is a complex task that entails the consideration of multiple streams of information, stakeholder preferences, value judgments, and uncertainty. We use a spatially explicit linked modeling process that incorporates geomorphological (SLAMM), habitat (MaxEnt), and metapopulation (RAMAS GIS) models to simulate the effect of sea-level rise on Snowy Plover populations. We then apply multi-criteria decision analysis to identify preferred management strategies for the conservation of the species. Results show that nest exclosures are the most promising conservation strategy followed by predator management, species focused beach nourishment, and no action. Uncertainty in these results remains an important concern, and a better understanding of decision-maker preferences and the Snowy Plover's life history would improve the reliability of the results. This is an innovative method for planning for sea-level rise through pairing a linked modeling system with decision analysis to provide management focused results under an inherently uncertain future.},

abstract = {Fire-scarred trees provide a deep temporal record of historical fire activity, but identifying the mechanisms therein that controlled landscape fire patterns is not straightforward. We use a spatially correlated metric for fire co-occurrence between pairs of trees (the Sorensen distance variogram), with output from a neutral model for fire history, to infer the relative strength of top-down vs. bottom-up controls on historical fire regimes. An inverse modeling procedure finds combinations of neutral-model parameters that produce Sorensen distance variograms with statistical properties similar to those observed from two landscapes in eastern Washington, USA, with contrasting topography. We find the most parsimonious model structure that is able to replicate the observed patterns and the parameters of this model provide surrogates for the predominance of top-down vs. bottom-up controls. Simulations with relatively low spread probability produce irregular fire perimeters and variograms similar to those from the topographically complex landscape. With higher spread probabilities fires exhibit regular perimeters and variograms similar to those from the simpler landscape. We demonstrate that cross-scale properties of the fire-scar record, even without historical fuels and weather data, document how complex topography creates strong bottom-up controls on fire spread. This control is weaker in simpler topography, and may be compromised in a future climate with more severe weather events.},

The thermal environment above the fire was measured in 14 of those fires. Existing plume models, based on the assumption of a uniformly burning line fire, were found to under-predict the temperature of the air rising into the canopy. An axially symmetric plume model, based on the observation that fires burning in non-uniform fuels are not uniformly burning line fires, was developed using standard plume rise equations. This model, called the Sporadic Axial Model (SAM), was calibrated using data from one fire. This model can be used to predict scorch height from known ambient temperature and Byram's fire line intensity. The SAM model suggests that scorch height will be greater for prescribed fires burnt under calm conditions than prescribed fires of the same intensity burnt under stronger wind conditions.},

Weights of the objectives, used for their local aggregation, are tuned in each iteration in order to assure a tendency for approaching the efficient solutions set while maintaining a uniform distribution of the generating solutions over this set.

abstract = {1. The biases and shortcomings of stepwise multiple regression are well established within the statistical literature. However, an examination of papers published in 2004 by three leading ecological and behavioural journals suggested that the use of this technique remains widespread: of 65 papers in which a multiple regression approach was used, 57% of studies used a stepwise procedure. 2. The principal drawbacks of stepwise multiple regression include bias in parameter estimation, inconsistencies among model selection algorithms, an inherent (but often overlooked) problem of multiple hypothesis testing, and an inappropriate focus or reliance on a single best model. We discuss each of these issues with examples. 3. We use a worked example of data on yellowhammer distribution collected over 4 years to highlight the pitfalls of stepwise regression. We show that stepwise regression allows models containing significant predictors to be obtained from each year's data. In spite of the significance of the selected models, they vary substantially between years and suggest patterns that are at odds with those determined by analysing the full, 4-year data set. 4. An information theoretic (IT) analysis of the yellowhammer data set illustrates why the varying outcomes of stepwise analyses arise. In particular, the IT approach identifies large numbers of competing models that could describe the data equally well, showing that no one model should be relied upon for inference.},

abstract = {The risks, hazards, and relative severity of wildland fires are presented here within the ecological context of historical natural fire regimes, time, space, and process. As the public dialogue on the role and impacts of wildland fire increases, it is imperative for all partners to converge on clear and concise terminology that defines risk, hazard, and the characteristic (or uncharacteristic) nature of wildland fire. These terms must be defined in the context of scale—both spatial and temporal. The concept of historical natural fire regimes involves a classification of the characteristic, or “natural” processes and effects associated with wildland fire occurring in sustainable ecosystems. When a wildland fire occurs within the time, space, and severity parameters of the historical natural fire regime, the fire can be called natural, or “characteristic”. The milieu of disturbance effects we call catastrophic, such as economic losses, damages to communities and structures, or impacts on short-term aesthetic values involve social, cultural, and economic values and risks—none is directly associated with ecological values, damages, or risks. In the context of technical risk assessments, the term “risk” considers not only the probability of an event, but also includes values and expected losses. However, within the fire community it refers only to the probability of ignition (both man- and lightning-caused). ‘Hazard' refers to the state of the fuel, exclusive of weather or the environs in which the fuel is found. Unlike many common uses of the term ‘severity', fire severity refers specifically to the effect a fire has on wildland systems. It is inappropriate to use the term severity to describe the behavior of the fire phenomenon itself. Instead, we should confine its use to that relating only to a fire's effect. Finally, I discuss the limitations and conflicts to integrating all social, cultural, economic, health, and safety values in our public and policy-forming dialogue relating to fire risk, hazard, and severity. Typical risk assessments consider all relevant endpoints, including socio-economic, management, as well as ecological elements. Herein, I use the Black Mountain 2 Fire from August 2003 in the northern Rockies to illustrate the spatiotemporal extent of fire's impacts on the endpoints. When expressed over all affected spatiotemporal scales, the overlay of all endpoints from this synthetic scenario results in a “decision space” ranging in time from an hour to a century, and in space ranging from a few square meters to the continent.},

The four RCPs together span the range of year 2100 radiative forcing values found in the open literature, i.e. from 2.6 to 8.5W/m2. The RCPs are the product of an innovative collaboration between integrated assessment modelers, climate modelers, terrestrial ecosystem modelers and emission inventory experts. The resulting product forms a comprehensive data set with high spatial and sectoral resolutions for the period extending to 2100. Land use and emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases are reported mostly at a 0.5×0.5 degree spatial resolution, with air pollutants also provided per sector (for well-mixed gases, a coarser resolution is used). The underlying integrated assessment model outputs for land use, atmospheric emissions and concentration data were harmonized across models and scenarios to ensure consistency with historical observations while preserving individual scenario trends. For most variables, the RCPs cover a wide range of the existing literature. The RCPs are supplemented with extensions (Extended Concentration Pathways, ECPs), which allow climate modeling experiments through the year 2300. The RCPs are an important development in climate research and provide a potential foundation for further research and assessment, including emissions mitigation and impact analysis.},

abstract = {Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 is a scenario that stabilizes radiative forcing at 4.5 W m in the year 2100 without ever exceeding that value. Simulated with the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), RCP4.5 includes long-term, global emissions of greenhouse gases, short-lived species, and land-use-land-cover in a global economic framework. RCP4.5 was updated from earlier GCAM scenarios to incorporate historical emissions and land cover information common to the RCP process and follows a cost-minimizing pathway to reach the target radiative forcing. The imperative to limit emissions in order to reach this target drives changes in the energy system, including shifts to electricity, to lower emissions energy technologies and to the deployment of carbon capture and geologic storage technology. In addition, the RCP4.5 emissions price also applies to land use emissions; as a result, forest lands expand from their present day extent. The simulated future emissions and land use were downscaled from the regional simulation to a grid to facilitate transfer to climate models. While there are many alternative pathways to achieve a radiative forcing level of 4.5 W m, the application of the RCP4.5 provides a common platform for climate models to explore the climate system response to stabilizing the anthropogenic components of radiative forcing.},

abstract = {Power law frequency-size distributions of forest fires have been observed in a range of environments. The scaling behaviour of fires, and more generally of landscape patterns related to recurring disturbance and recovery, have previously been explained in the frameworks of self-organized criticality (SOC) and highly optimized tolerance (HOT). In these frameworks the scaling behaviour of the fires is the global structure that either emerges spontaneously from locally operating processes (SOC) or is the product of a tuning process aimed at optimizing the trade-offs between system yield and tolerance to risks (HOT). Here, we argue that the dominant role of selforganized or optimised fuel patterns in constraining unplanned-fire sizes, implicit in the SOC and HOT frameworks, fails to recognise the strong exogenous controls of fire spread (i.e. by weather, terrain, and suppression) observed in many fire-prone landscapes. Using data from southern Australia we demonstrate that forest fire areas and the magnitudes of corresponding weather events have distributions with closely matching scaling exponents. We conclude that the spatial scale invariance of forest fires may also be a mapping of the meteorological forcing pattern.},

abstract = {Acute changes in ecological disturbance regimes can have major consequences for ecosystems and biota, including humans, living within them. Human suppression of fire in the western United States over the last century has caused notable changes to many ecosystems, especially in lower elevation, semiarid forest types dominated historically by fire tolerant taxa like Pinus and Quercus. Recent increases in fire activity in western US forests have highlighted the need for restoration of ecological structure and function, but management targets for restoration in different forest types remain uncertain.Working in the forests of eastern California, we evaluated the direction and magnitude of change in burned area and fire severity between the period prior to Euro-American settlement (;1500–1850) and the ‘‘modern'' period (1984–2009). We compared total annual area burned; proportional area burned at low-moderate severity and high severity; and annual area burned at low-moderate severity and high severity between the two time periods in seven forest types. We also examined modern trends in fire area and severity. We found that modern rates of burning are far below presettlement levels for all forest types. However, there were major differences between low to middle elevation forests and high elevation forests regarding the components of this departure. Low and middle elevation forests are currently burning at much higher severities than during the presettlement period, and the departure in fire area is overwhelmingly expressed in the low to moderate severity categories; in these forest types, mean annual area of high severity fire is not notably different between the modern and presettlement periods. In higher elevation forests on the other hand, the modern departure in fire area is expressed equally across fire severity categories. Our results underline the critical need for forest and fire restoration in the study area, especially in low and middle elevation forests adapted to frequent, low severity fire. Expanded management of naturally ignited fires for resource benefit is clearly needed, but in many parts of our study area, strategic reduction of forest fuels will likely be necessary before large-scale restoration of fire becomes ecologically, politically, and financially feasible.},

abstract = {Fires constitute one major ecological disturbance which influences the
natural cycle of vegetation succession and the structure and function
of ecosystems. There is no single natural scale at which ecological
phenomena are completely understood and thus the capacity to handle
scale is beneficial to methodological frameworks for analyzing and
monitoring ecosystems. Although satellite imagery has been widely
applied for the assessment of fire related topics, there are few
studies that consider fire at several spatial scales simultaneously.
This research explores the relationships between fire occurrence and
several families of environmental factors at different spatial
observation scales by means of classification and regression tree
models. Predictors accounting for vegetation status (estimated by
spectral indices derived from Landsat imagery), fire history,
topography, accessibility and vegetation types were included in the
models of fire occurrence probability. We defined four scales of
analysis by identifying four meaningful thresholds related to fire
sizes in the study site. Sampling methodology was based on random
points and the power-law distribution describing the local fire regime.
The observation scale drastically affected tree size, and therefore the
achieved level of detail, and the most explanatory variables in the
trees. As a general trend, trees considering all the variables showed a
spectral index ruling the most explicative split. According to the
comparison of the four pre-determined analysis scales, we propose the
existence of three eventual organization levels: landscape patch or
ecosystem level, local level and the basic level, the most
heterogeneous and complex scale. Rules with three levels of complexity
and applicability for management were defined in the tree models: (i)
the repeated critical thresholds (predictor values across which fire
characteristics change rapidly), (ii) the meaningful final probability
classes and (iii) the trees themselves. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All

abstract = {LANDIS is a cell-based spatially explicit forest landscape model
designed to explore successional dynamics under natural and
anthropogenic disturbances. Species age cohort (10-year cohort of a
given tree species) information is required for each cell in LANDIS.
However, providing such information for a landscape comprising millions
of cells is challenging. In this study, a stand-based assignation (SBA)
approach was developed to stochastically assign species age cohorts to
each cell based on forest inventory data. As a probability-based
approach, SBA will introduce errors in LANDIS input. In order to assess
the effect of errors produced by SBA on LANDIS results, 20 Monte Carlo
simulations were produced. For each species simulated in LANDIS, the
recurrence frequency (RF) of the majority species age cohort (MSAC, the
most frequently Occurring species age cohort) from 20 Monte Carlo
simulations were used to quantify the uncertainty in species age cohorts
for individual cell. Average recurrence frequency (ARF) of the MSAC was
used to quantify the overall uncertainty in species age cohorts at the
cell level. For each species, the coefficient of variation (CV) for the
percent area and an aggregation index for the 20 Monte Carlo simulations
was used to quantify the uncertainty at the landscape level. Results
showed that at the cell level, uncertainty was relatively low at the
beginning of the simulation (ARF was larger than 10). Seed dispersal,
seedling establishment, mortality, and fire disturbance caused
uncertainty to increase with simulation year. The uncertainty finally
reached an equilibrium state, where input errors in original species age
cohorts had little effect on the simulation outcomes. At the landscape
level, species percent area and their spatial patterns were not
substantially affected by the uncertainties in species age structure at
the cell level. Since the typical use of LANDIS is to predict the
long-term landscape pattern change, SBA can be used to parameterize
species age cohorts for individual cells. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All

Data mainly derived from Mediterranean shrublands and a spatially close meteorological station have been used to derive probability distribution functions for the variables involved. In spite of the abundant non-linearities contained in the equations studied, scale effects found have been relatively unimportant, thus supporting the current usage of spatial averages (i.e. fuel models) in spatially distributed models based on the Rothermel equations. On the other hand, the results of the GSA clearly showed the negligible effect of the variability of three of the model variables (the low heat content, the particle density and the mineral content) on the output values. However, all other input variables had some noticeable effect over the variability of the output, and they cannot be ignored if an optimal use of the model is desired. Finally, caution is recommended if results have to be extrapolated to other types of vegetation or climate},

abstract = {Landscapes are strongly shaped by the degree of interaction between pattern and process. This paper examines how ecological memory, the degree to which an ecological process is shaped by its past modifications of a landscape, influences landscape dynamics. I use a simulation model to examine how ecological memory shapes the landscape dynamics produced by the interaction of vegetative regrowth and fire. The model illustrated that increased ecological memory increased the strength and spatial extent of landscape pattern. The extent of these changes depended upon the relative rates of vegetative recovery and fire initiation. When ecological memory is strong, landscape pattern is persistent; pattern tends to be maintained rather than destroyed by fire. The generality of the simulation model suggests that these results may also apply to disturbance processes other than fire. The existence of ecological memory in ecosystems may allow processes to produce ecological pattern that can entrain other ecosystem variables. The methods presented in this paper to analyze pattern in model ecosystems could be used to detect such pattern in actual ecosystems.},

questions: How much old-growth forest should exist? And where can they
be sustained in a landscape? Stand-level knowledge of old-growth
physiognomy and dynamics are not sufficient to answer these questions.
We assert that large-scale disturbance regimes may provide a strong
foundation to understand the spatio-temporal ageing patterns in forest
landscapes that determine the potential for old growth. Approaches to
describe large-scale disturbance regimes range from scenarios
reconstructed from historical evidence to simulation of landscapes using
predictive models. In this paper, we describe a simulation modelling
approach to determine landscape-ageing patterns, and thereby the
landscape potential of old-growth forests. A spatially explicit
stochastic simulation model of landscape fire-forest cover dynamics was
applied to a 1.8 million-ha case study boreal forest landscape to
quantify the spatio-temporal variation of landscape ageing. Twenty-five
replicates of 200-year simulation runs of the fire disturbance regime,
at a 1-ha resolution, generated a suite of variables of landscape ageing
and their error estimates. These included temporal variation of older
age cohorts over 200 years, survivorship distribution at the 200(th)
year, and spatial tendencies of ageing. This information, in combination
with spatial tendency of species occurrence, constitutes the contextual
framework to plan how much old-growth forest a given landscape can
sustain, and where such forest could be located.},

abstract = {Changes in vegetation and fuels were evaluated from measurements taken before and after fuel reduction treatments (prescribed fire, mechanical treatments, and the combination of the two) at 12 Fire and Fire Surrogate (FFS) sites located in forests with a surface fire regime across the conterminous United States. To test the relative effectiveness of fuel reduction treatments and their effect on ecological parameters we used an information-theoretic approach on a suite of 12 variables representing the overstory (basal area and live tree, sapling, and snag density), the understory (seedling density, shrub cover, and native and alien herbaceous species richness), and the most relevant fuel parameters for wildfire damage (height to live crown, total fuel bed mass, forest floor mass, and woody fuel mass). In the short term (one year after treatment), mechanical treatments were more effective at reducing overstory tree density and basal area and at increasing quadratic mean tree diameter. Prescribed fire treatments were more effective at creating snags, killing seedlings, elevating height to live crown, and reducing surface woody fuels. Overall, the response to fuel reduction treatments of the ecological variables presented in this paper was generally maximized by the combined mechanical plus burning treatment. If the management goal is to quickly produce stands with fewer and larger diameter trees, less surface fuel mass, and greater herbaceous species richness, the combined treatment gave the most desirable results. However, because mechanical plus burning treatments also favored alien species invasion at some sites, monitoring and control need to be part of the prescription when using this treatment.},

abstract = {Landscape patterns in the northwestern United States are mostly shaped by the interaction of fire and succession, and conversely, vegetation patterns influence fire dynamics and plant colonization processes. Historical landscape pattern dynamics can be used by resource managers to assess current landscape conditions and develop target spatial characteristics for management activities. The historical range and variability (HRV) of landscape pattern can be quantified from simulated chronosequences of landscape vegetation maps and can be used to (1) describe temporal variation in patch statistics, (2) develop limits of acceptable change, and (3) design landscape treatment guidelines for ecosystem management. Although this simulation approach has many advantages, the limitations of this method have not been explored in detail. To demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of this approach, we performed several simulation experiments using the spatially explicit, multiple pathway model a LANDscape Succession Model (LANDSUM) to quantify the range and variability in six class and landscape pattern metrics for four landscapes in the northwestern United States. First, we applied the model to spatially nested landscapes to evaluate the effect of landscape size on the HRV pattern metrics. Next, we averaged the HRV pattern metrics across maps generated from simulation time spans of 100, 500, and 1000 years and intervals 5, 10, 25 and 50 years to assess optimal output generation parameters. We then altered the elevation data layer to evaluate effect of topography on pattern metrics, and cut various shapes (circle, rectangle, square) from a landscape to examine landscape shape and orientation influences. Then, we altered the input vegetation maps to assess the influence of initial conditions on landscape metrics output. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of input fire probabilities and transition times was performed. Results indicate landscapes should be quite large to realistically simulation fire pattern. Landscape shape, and orientation are critically important to quantifying patch metrics. Simulation output need only be stored every 20–50 years but landscapes should be simulated for long time periods (1000 years). All landscapes are unique so conclusions generated here may not be entirely applicable to all western US landscapes.},

We examine fire regimes in forests of western North America, focusing on how observed patterns of fire frequency change across spatial scales. To quantify changes in fire frequency across spatial scale, we derive the event-area (EA) relationship and the analogous interval-area (IA) relationship using historical and simulated data from low- and high-severity fire regimes. The EA and IA provide multi-scale descriptions of fire regimes, as opposed to standard metrics that may apply only at a single scale. Parameters and properties of scaling functions (intercept, slope, minimum value) are associated statistically with properties of the fire regime, such as mean fire-free intervals and fire size distributions, but are not direct mathematical transformations of them because they also reflect mechanistic drivers of fire that are non-stationary in time and space. Patterns in fire-scaling relations can be used to identify how controls on fire regimes change across spatial and temporal scales. Future research that considers fire as a cross-scale process will be directly applicable to landscape-scale fire management.},

abstract = {Remotely sensed indices of burn severity are now commonly used by researchers and land managers to assess fire effects, but their relationship to field-based assessments of burn severity has been evaluated only in a few ecosystems. This analysis illustrates two cases in which methodological refinements to field-based and remotely sensed indices of burn severity developed in one location did not show the same improvement when used in a new location. We evaluated three methods of assessing burn severity in the field: the Composite Burn Index (CBI)—a standardized method of assessing burn severity that combines ecologically significant variables related to burn severity into one numeric site index—and two modifications of the CBI that weight the plot CBI score by the percentage cover of each stratum. Unexpectedly, models using the CBI had higher R2 and better classification accuracy than models using the weighted versions of the CBI. We suggest that the weighted versions of the CBI have lower accuracies because weighting by percentage cover decreases the influence of the dominant tree stratum, which should have the strongest relationship to optically sensed reflectance, and increases the influence of the substrates strata, which should have the weakest relationship with optically sensed reflectance in forested ecosystems. Using a large data set of CBI plots (n = 251) from four fires and CBI scores derived from additional field-based assessments of burn severity (n = 388), we predicted two metrics of image-based burn severity, the Relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) and the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). Predictive models for RdNBR showed slightly better classification accuracy than for dNBR (overall accuracy = 62%, Kappa = 0.40, and overall accuracy = 59%, Kappa= 0.36, respectively), whereas dNBR had slightly better explanatory power, but strong differences were not apparent.

abstract = {The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program of the USDA Forest Service conducts a national inventory of forests of the United States. A subset of FIA permanent inventory plots are sampled every year for indicators of forest health such as soils, understory vegetation, and down woody materials (DWM). The DWM indicator provides estimates of down and dead woody materials in forest ecosystems. Estimates of DWM are used in assessments of forest-ecosystem attributes such as fuel loadings, carbon stocks, and structural diversity. As defined by the FIA program, DWM comprises fine and coarse woody debris, slash piles, duff, litter, and shrub/herbs cover and height. Components of DWM are sampled using the line-intersect method, point sampling, and fixed-radius sampling. DWM data analyses are an integral part of national inventory reports, multi-scale forest-health reports, and wildlife-habitat, and fuel-loading assessments. The DWM inventory began in 2001 and currently is implemented in 46 states and two territories. In this report we provide the rationale and context for a national inventory of DWM, describe woody material components sampled by the DWM indicator, discuss the sampling protocol used to measure the DWM components and corresponding estimation procedures, and provide guidance on managing and processing DWM data and incorporating that information into pertinent inventory analyses and research projects.},

abstract = {This article evaluates the performance of five traditional methods and one new method of generating the efficient frontier for a bi-criteria, spatially explicit harvest scheduling problem. The problem is to find all possible efficient solutions, thus defining the trade-offs between two objectives: (1) maximizing the net present value of the forest and (2) maximizing the minimum area over the planning horizon in large, mature forest patches. The methods for generating the efficient frontier were tested using a hypothetical forest consisting of 50 stands. The methods were compared based on the number of efficient solutions each method can identify and on how quickly the solutions were identified. The potential to generalize these algorithms to 3- or n-criteria cases is also assessed. Three of the traditional approaches, the epsilon-constraining; the triangles method, the decomposition algorithm based on the Tchebycheff metric; and the new, proposed method are capable of generating all or most of the efficient solutions. However, the triangles and the new method far outperformed the other approaches in terms of solution time. The new method, called alpha-delta, appears to be the simplest to generalize to the tri-criteria case.},

The proposed model is useful for situations where the variable of interest is continuous and restricted to the interval (0, 1) and is related to other variables through a regression structure. The regression parameters of the beta regression model are interpretable in terms of the mean of the response and, when the logit link is used, of an odds ratio, unlike the parameters of a linear regression that employs a transformed response. Estimation is performed by maximum likelihood. We provide closed-form expressions for the score function, for Fisher's information matrix and its inverse. Hypothesis testing is performed using approximations obtained from the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. Some diagnostic measures are introduced. Finally, practical applications that employ real data are presented and discussed.},

abstract = {Many if not all data collected in ecology have both a spatial as well as a temporal dimension. This suggests the use of summary characteristics from spatial statistics to gain more refined insight into plant interactions. Spatial tree data can for example be considered as point patterns (formed by tree locations) with attached marks (e.g. tree sizes). If only the pattern of tree locations is of interest one can use for example the pair correlation function. If in addition, the sizes (or some other characteristics) of trees or other plants are of interest, marked summary statistics can be more suitable. In this paper, we propose the so-called mark variogram as a useful tool in ecological studies. This summary characteristic basically indicates how similar two plants within a certain distance from each other are. For example, if two plants are approximately of the same size, the mark variogram has small values, and if their sizes differ somewhat, the mark variogram has large values. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion on how to interpret the shape of mark variograms caused by pairs of plants with different sizes at close proximity. Such variogram shapes exhibiting so-called negative autocorrelation, another expression for high small-scaled size diversity, are assumed to indicate strong competition between plants. In this study, we reconstructed two spatial tree time series where negative autocorrelation has occurred and also simulated four alternative forest development paths in order to experimentally explore the causes of negative autocorrelation. Interestingly the results highlighted that man-made disturbances (e.g. thinnings) often result in a significant number of pairs of large and small trees at close proximity leading to negative autocorrelation. We could also show that whilst negative autocorrelation can be the consequence of natural forest development including competition processes, it can, however, also be the consequence of disturbances and of subsequent colonisation by small trees. Since disturbances play an important role in the development of negative autocorrelation, the mark variogram is a key summary characteristic in disturbance ecology.},

A new approach to this issue integrates concepts and tools from silviculture and fuel science to quantify outcomes for a large number of treatment options in dry forest stands in the western United States. Five silvicultural options (thinning from below to 50 trees per acre [tpa]; 100, 200, and 300 tpa; or no thinning) are considered in combination with three surface fuel treatments (pile and burn, prescribed fire, or no treatment), resulting in a range of alternative treatments for each representative stand. The Fire and Fuels Extension of the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FFE-FVS) was used to calculate (1) immediate effects of treatments on surface fuels, fire hazard, potential fire behavior, and forest structure (including visualizations); and (2) a 50-year time series of treatment effects at 10-year increments. These fuel treatment scenarios can be used as a starting point for examining alternatives for National Environmental Policy Act documents and other applications that require scientifically based information to quantify the effects of modifying forest structure and surface fuels. Forest managers also can develop customized treatments for specific locations and resource objectives. Scenarios and output can be used to inform ecological, economic, and sociological evaluations of the effects of fuel and vegetation treatments.},

abstract = {* Ecological data such as biomasses often present a high proportion of zeros with possible skewed positive values. The Delta-Gamma (DG) approach, which models separately the presence–absence and the positive biomass, is commonly used in ecology. A less commonly known alternative is the compound Poisson-gamma (CPG) approach, which essentially mimics the process of capturing clusters of biomass during a sampling event.\n\n\n* Regardless of the approach, the effort involved in obtaining a sample (henceforth called the sampling volume, but could also include swept areas, sampling durations, etc.), which can potentially be quite variable between samples, needs to be taken into account when modelling the resulting sample biomass. This is achieved empirically for the DG approach (using a generalized linear model with sampling volume as a covariate), and theoretically for the CPG approach (by scaling a parameter of the model). In this study, the consequences of this disparity between approaches were explored first using theoretical arguments, then using simulations and finally by applying the approaches to catch data from a commercial groundfish trawl fishery.\n\n\n* The simulation study results point out that the DG approach can lead to poor estimates when far from standard idealized sampling assumptions. On the contrary, the CPG approach is much more robust to variable sampling conditions, confirming theoretical predictions. These results were confirmed by the case study for which model performances were weaker for the DG.\n\n\n* Given the results, care must be taken when choosing an approach for dealing with zero-inflated continuous data. The DG approach, which is easily implemented using standard statistical softwares, works well when the sampling volume variability is small. However, better results were obtained with the CPG model when dealing with variable sampling volumes.},

abstract = {Ecological data frequently containmultiple patterns. A process model of the system producing the data should be able to recreate those patterns.We describe amethod and associated software where components of the pattern are used as multiple criteria to assess a model during its construction. Successive improvements aremade to the model so that it describes more components of the pattern effectively. The software, Pareto Evolve is an evolutionary algorithm. Initially it creates many individual sets of model parameters, each is used in the model to produce results that are then compared to patterns in a data set. Different individuals may achieve different components of the pattern and Pareto Evolve calculates those that are most effective and uses them to produce new individuals. This is done by changing parameter values of individuals, called mutation, or exchanging parameter values between individuals, called crossover. This process is repeated over many generations so that a most effective parameterization evolves. We illustrate this method with a model for hourly increments of extension of the leading shoot of a conifer tree. The particular task here is to model water uptake by the plant in response to water loss due to transpiration, calculate a water deficit between uptake and loss, and calculate contraction and re-expansion of shoot tissue due to diurnal changes in tissue water deficit. We choose criteria corresponding to different phases in the diurnal pattern of expansion and model for up to six consecutive days. A value is set marking the limit within which the model must achieve the criteria for it to be judged as success. This value is called a binary discrepancy measure. Pareto Evolve is used to make multiple searches with successively smaller binary discrepancy measures until all criteria are no longer achieved. At this point different parameter sets achieve different groups of criteria and we use these as indicators of how the structure of the model must be improved to achieve an overall better fit. In our example we find that contraction is more rapid than re-expansion, which is a hysteresis effect, and that reexpansion of tissue continues after water deficit within the tissue is estimated to have been removed. We discuss how this method can be used in model development and particularly how multiple criteria assessment can be used in model development.},

abstract = {Simulation models help to understand how individual interactions can lead to selforganization of large, moving polarized schools of fish. To some extend the underlying mechanisms in these models are still hypothetical. This paper investigates and confirms previously published results and suggests an alternative model. Previous models of fish schools used the assumption that individuals modify their swimming direction and speed as a reaction to a small fixed number of other individuals swimming closest to their own swimming direction (front priority). They also used discrete transitions between different reaction types to their neighbours (see Huth and Wissel, this volume). These models are able to simulate school movement in a homogeneous environment but fail under certain heterogeneous conditions (e.g. when schools meet obstacles) and do not adequately simulate the formation process of schools. We present an alternative model, in which a fish's new speed and swimming direction is influenced by all visible neighbours. Each neighbour contributes a vector component weighted according to its distance. These components are aggregated to determine to what extent the different behavioural modes of searching, attraction, parallel orientation and repulsion contribute to a modification of an individual's movement in a particular situation. The resulting model reproduces schooling behaviour, organization of schools and has fewer artificial requirements concerning a biological interpretation of the underlying mechanisms. It shows how a comparison of different modelling approaches, empirical observation of inter-organismic interaction, and physiological research can stimulate each other in order to understand a complex, dynamic phenomenon. ?? 1994.},

Franco forests to establish reference spatial patterns for restoration thinning treatments, and to determine whether thinning treatments with minimum intertree spacing rules result in spatial patterns characteristic of late-successional forests. On average, 32.7% of overstory trees in Abies plots and 26.3% of overstory trees in Pseudotsuga plots occurred as members of multitree clusters (groups of trees in which trees are spaced within a specified minimum distance of each other) at a distance of 3.0 and 4.0 m, respectively. Multitree clusters occurred throughout the three Abies plots; the distribution of multitree clusters within the two Pseudotsuga plots was variable. Spatial patterns of overstory trees in late-successional forests were significantly different from those created by simulated restoration thinning treatments. Restoration thinning treatments that release both individual trees and multitree clusters promote characteristic late-successional tree spatial patterns at the within-patch scale (<0.04 ha). This formulation of restoration thinning highlights conservation of existing small-scale (<0.04 ha) spatial heterogeneity within the treatment area, elaborating on current practices that emphasize introduction of spatial heterogeneity at scales of 0.04 ha to 1.0 ha.},

abstract = {Although mixed-severity fires are among the most widespread disturbances influencing western North American forests, they remain the least understood. A major question is the degree to which mixed-severity fire regimes are simply an ecological intermediate between low- and high-severity fire regimes, versus a unique disturbance regime with distinct properties. The Klamath-Siskiyou Mountains of southwestern Oregon and northwestern California provide an excellent laboratory for studies of mixedseverity fire effects, as structurally diverse vegetation types in the region foster, and partly arise from, fires of variable severity. In addition, many mixed-severity fires have occurred in the region in the last several decades, including the nationally significant 200,000-ha Biscuit Fire. Since 2002, we have engaged in studies of early ecosystem response to 15 of these fires, ranging from determinants of fire effects to responses of vegetation, wildlife, and biogeochemistry. We present here some of our important early findings regarding mixed-severity fire, thereby updating the state of the science on mixed-severity fire regimes and highlighting questions and hypotheses to be tested in future studies on mixed-severity fire regimes. Our studies in the Klamath-Siskiyou Ecoregion suggest that forests with mixed-severity fire regimes are characterized primarily by their intimately mixed patches of vegetation of varied age, resulting from complex variations in both fire frequency and severity and species responses to this variation. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that the proximity of living and dead forest after mixed-severity fire, and the close mingling of early- and late-seral communities, results in unique vegetation and wildlife responses compared to predominantly low- or high-severity fires. These factors also appear to contribute to high resilience of plant and wildlife species to mixed-severity fire in the Klamath-Siskiyou Ecoregion. More informed management of ecosystems with mixed-severity regimes requires understanding of their wide variability in space and time, and the particular ecological responses that this variability elicits.},

abstract = {P>We used a climate-vegetation-natural fire (CVNF) conceptual model to
evaluate the sensitivity and vulnerability of forest, savanna, and the
forest-savanna transition to environmental changes in tropical South
America.
Initially, under current environmental conditions, CVNF model results
suggested that, in the absence of fires, tropical forests would extend
c. 200 km into the presently observed savanna domain.
Environmental changes were then imposed upon the model in temperature,
precipitation and lightning strikes. These changes ranged from 2 to 6
degrees C warming, +10 to -20% precipitation change and 0 to 15%
increase in lightning frequency, which, in aggregate form, represent
expected future climatic changes in response to global warming and
deforestation.
The most critical vegetation changes are projected to take place over
the easternmost portions of the basin, with a widening of the
forest-savanna transition. The transition width would increase from 150
to c. 300 km, with tree cover losses ranging from 20 to 85%. This
means that c. 6% of the areas currently covered by forests could
potentially turn into grass-dominated savanna landscapes. The mechanism
driving tree cover reduction consists of the combination of less
favorable climate conditions for trees and more fire activity. In
addition, this sensitivity analysis predicts that the current dry
shrubland vegetation of northeast Brazil could potentially turn into a
bare soil landscape.},

abstract = {Fire managers are now realizing that wildfires can be beneficial because they can reduce hazardous fuels and restore fire-dominated ecosystems. A software tool that assesses potential beneficial and detrimental ecological effects from wildfire would be helpful to fire management. This paper presents a simulation platform called FLEAT (Fire and Landscape Ecology Assessment Tool) that integrates several existing landscape- and stand-level simulation models to compute an ecologically based measure that describes if a wildfire is moving the burning landscape towards or away from the historical range and variation of vegetation composition. FLEAT uses a fire effects model to simulate fire severity, which is then used to predict vegetation development for 1, 10, and 100 years into the future using a landscape simulation model. The landscape is then simulated for 5000 years using parameters derived from historical data to create an historical time series that is compared to the predicted landscape composition at year 1, 10, and 100 to compute a metric that describes their similarity to the simulated historical conditions. This tool is designed to be used in operational wildfire management using the LANDFIRE spatial database so that fire managers can decide how aggressively to suppress wildfires. Validation of fire severity predictions using field data from six wildfires revealed that while accuracy is moderate (30-60%), it is mostly dictated by the quality of GIS layers input to FLEAT. Predicted 1-year landscape compositions were only 8% accurate but this was because the LANDFIRE mapped pre-fire composition accuracy was low (21%). This platform can be integrated into current readily available software products to produce an operational tool for balancing benefits of wildfire with potential dangers.},

The study area is a mixed-evergreen forest of southwestern Oregon with a mixed-severity fire regime. Modeled fire behavior showed that thinning reduced canopy fuels, thereby decreasing the potential for crown fire spread. The potential for crown fire initiation remained fairly constant despite reductions in ladder fuels, because thinning increased surface fuels, which contributed to greater surface fire intensity. Thinning followed by underburning reduced canopy, ladder, and surface fuels, thereby decreasing surface fire intensity and crown fire potential. However, crown fire is not a prerequisite for high fire severity; damage to and mortality of overstory trees in the wildfire were extensive despite the absence of crown fire. Mortality was most severe in thinned treatments (80%–100%), moderate in untreated stands (53%–54%), and least severe in the thinned and underburned treatment (5%). Thinned treatments had higher fine-fuel loading and more extensive crown scorch, suggesting that greater consumption of fine fuels contributed to higher tree mortality. Fuel treatments intended to minimize tree mortality will be most effective if both ladder and surface fuels are treated.},

abstract = {Wildland fire is an important natural process in many ecosystems. However, fire exclusion has reduced frequency of fire and area burned in many dry forest types, which may affect vegetation structure and composition, and potential fire behavior. In forests of the western U.S., these effects pose a challenge for fire and land managers who seek to restore the ecological process of fire to ecosystems. Recent research suggests that landscapes with unaltered fire regimes are more “self-regulating” than those that have experienced fire-regime shifts; in self-regulating systems, fire size and severity are moderated by the effect of previous fire. To determine if burn severity is moderated in areas that recently burned, we analyzed 117 wildland fires in 2 wilderness areas in the western U.S. that have experienced substantial recent fire activity. Burn severity was measured using a Landsat satellite-based metric at a 30-m resolution. We evaluated (1) whether pixels that burned at least twice since 1984 experienced lower burn severity than pixels that burned once, (2) the relationship between burn severity and fire history, pre-fire vegetation, and topography, and (3) how the moderating effect of a previous fire decays with time. Results show burn severity is significantly lower in areas that have recently burned compared to areas that have not. This effect is still evident at around 22 years between wildland fire events. Results further indicate that burn severity generally increases with time since and severity of previous wildfire. These findings may assist land managers to anticipate the consequences of allowing fires to burn and provide rationale for using wildfire as a “fuel treatment”.},

abstract = {Knowing how species respond to fire regimes is essential for
ecologically sustainable management. This axiom raises two important
questions: (1) what knowledge is the most important to develop and (2)
to what extent can current research methods deliver that knowledge? We
identify three areas of required knowledge: (i) a mechanistic
understanding of species' responses to fire regimes; (ii) knowledge of
how the spatial and temporal arrangement of fires influences the biota;
and (iii) an understanding of interactions of fire regimes with other
processes. We review the capacity of empirical research to address
these knowledge gaps, and reveal many limitations. Manipulative
experiments are limited by the number and scope of treatments that can
be applied, natural experiments are limited by treatment availability
and confounding factors, and longitudinal studies are difficult to
maintain, particularly due to unplanned disturbance events. Simulation
modelling is limited by the quality of the underlying empirical data
and by uncertainty in how well model structure represents reality. Due
to the constraints on large-scale, long-term research, the potential
for management experiments to inform adaptive management is limited.
Rather than simply recommending adaptive management, we define a
research agenda to maximise the rate of learning in this difficult
field. This includes measuring responses at a species level, building
capacity to implement natural experiments, undertaking simulation
modelling, and judicious application of experimental approaches.
Developing ecologically sustainable fire management practices will
require sustained research effort and a sophisticated research agenda
based on carefully targeting appropriate methods to address critical

abstract = {Most countries endorse a limit of either 2°C or 1.5°C global warming above pre-industrial levels. However, for several reasons, there is still a significant uncertainty in the climate sensitivity parameter, which relates greenhouse gas concentration (or other forcings) to steady-state temperature. One key source of uncertainty is the disagreement about the appropriate prior for Bayesian estimation. A common choice is the uniform distribution, often thought to contain no information. However, when used to estimate sensitivity it leads to paradoxical results, which have been interpreted as revealing an inherent indeterminacy in the prior of choice. If this were the case, part of the uncertainty would be irreducible. Here I develop an objective Bayesian approach to this problem. I show that both Jaynes' invariant groups criterion and a new criterion based on information theory lead to the conclusion that there is a uniquely defined non-informative prior of climate sensitivity, which is distinct from the uniform and solves the paradox. This prior distribution is the log-uniform. Furthermore, this result is supported empirically by the observation that other comparable non-equilibrium parameters display a scale-invariant, log-uniform-like frequency distribution. Rather than advocating a direct use of this prior, I recommend to refine it with a limited use of expert elicitation or other methods. A sound prior is a key ingredient in the process to reach a consensus low-uncertainty estimate of climate sensitivity to inform climate policy.},

abstract = {Even if measurement error could be completely eliminated, biological systems are inherently variable, and there are fundamental limits on the predictability of the temporal dynamics of many critical forcing functions. How do we incorporate the important sources of uncertainty in our ecosystem models and determine confidence in model output? How does uncertainty constrain our approaches to prediction? This chapter addresses these questions in a discussion of fundamental concepts in predictive ecosystem modeling, including, optimal model size, predictive power, uncertainties in empirical y and x variables (y = target variable to be predicted; x = model variable), uncertainties in model structures, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analyses (using Monte Carlo techniques), and uncertainties related to step-by-step predictions. Examples are given for aquatic ecosystems using both statistical regression models and dynamical mass-balance models based on differential equations. To meet demands in ecosystem management for generality, practical usefulness, and predictive power, models should not only as small as possible and driven by readily accessible variables but also be well balanced, which means that the predictions of the variables do not depend too much on inherent uncertainties associated with just one or a few critical model variables. Such poorly balanced models have generic problems, which means that they will have a good predictive power only in a restricted domain.},

These models of self-organization suggest that characteristic patterns should exist across a broad range of environmental conditions provided that local interactions do indeed dominate the development of community structure. Readily available observations that could be used to support these theoretical expectations, however, have lacked sufficient spatial extent or the necessary diversity of environmental conditions to confirm the model predictions. We use high-resolution satellite imagery to document the prevalence of self-organized vegetation patterns across a regional rainfall gradient in southern Africa, where percent tree cover ranges from 65% to 4%. Through the application of a cellular automata model, we find that the observed power-law distributions of tree canopy cluster sizes can arise from the interacting effects of global-scale resource constraints (that is, water availability) and local-scale facilitation. Positive local feedbacks result in power-law distributions without entailing threshold behaviour commonly associated with criticality. Our observations provide a framework for integrating a diverse suite of previous studies that have addressed either mean wet season rainfall or landscape-scale soil moisture variability as controls on the structural dynamics of arid and semi-arid ecosystems.},

abstract = {Ongoing forest restoration on public lands in the western US is a concerted effort to counter the growing incidence of uncharacteristic wildfire in fire-adapted ecosystems. Restoration projects cover 725,000 ha annually, and include thinning and underburning to remove ladder and surface fuel, and seeding of fire-adapted native grasses and shrubs. The backlog of areas in need of restoration combined with limited budgets requires that projects are implemented according to a prioritization system. The current system uses a stand-scale metric that measures ecological departure from pre-settlement conditions. Although conceptually appealing, the approach does not consider important spatial factors that influence both the efficiency and feasibility of managing future fire in the post-treatment landscape. To address this gap, we developed a spatial model that can be used to explore different landscape treatment configurations and identify optimal project parameters that maximize restoration goals. We tested the model on a 245,000 ha forest and analyzed tradeoffs among treatment strategies as defined by fire behavior thresholds, total area treated, and the proportion of the project area treated. We assumed the primary goal as the protection and conservation of old growth ponderosa pine trees from potential wildfire loss. The model located optimal project areas for restoration and identified treatment areas within them, although the location was dependent on assumptions about acceptable fire intensity within restored landscapes, and the total treated area per project. When a high percentage of stands was treated (e.g., .80%), the resulting project area was relatively small, leaving the surrounding landscape at risk for fire. Conversely, treating only a few stands with extreme fire behavior (,20%) created larger projects, but substantial old growth forests remained susceptible to wildfire mortality within the project area. Intermediate treatment densities (35%) were optimal in terms of the overall reduction in the potential wildfire mortality of old growth. The current work expands the application in spatial optimization to the problem of dry forest restoration, and demonstrates a decision support protocol to prioritize landscapes and specific areas to treat within them. The concepts and model can be applied to similar problems in spatial ecology},

often attributed to the disproportionate effects of stochastic
fluctuations on small populations, but it also may be explained by
deterministic relationships between patch area and vital rates (i.e.,
fecundity and survival). We explored the consequences of including
deterministic relationships between patch area and vital rates in
metapopulation models. Field studies have revealed that fecundity and
monthly survivorship were positively associated with patch size for the
Florida scrub lizard (Sceloporus woodi). Using simulation techniques, we
compared metapopulation, models of artificial landscapes that included
vital rates for this species (scaled for patch area) to models that used
averaged estimates of vital rates for all patches. These two types of
metapopulation models produced dramatically different results with
respect to the proportion of occupied patches and the extinction
probability of the regional population. Including deterministic
relationships between patch area and vital rates often resulted in
either all patches being occupied or all patches going extinct,
depending on the size of the local,patches. Few artificial landscapes
resulted in a dynamic colonization-extinction equilibrium characteristic

Although local and basin-scale differences in riverine fish diversity have been analysed as functions of energy availability and habitat heterogeneity, scale-dependent environmental conditions and river discharge, a model that predicts a comprehensive set of system-wide diversity patterns has been hard to find. Here we show that fish diversity patterns throughout the Mississippi-Missouri River System are well described by a neutral metacommunity model coupled with an appropriate habitat capacity distribution and dispersal kernel. River network structure acts as an effective template for characterizing spatial attributes of fish biodiversity. We show that estimates of average dispersal behaviour and habitat capacities, objectively calculated from average runoff production, yield reliable predictions of large-scale spatial biodiversity patterns in riverine systems. The success of the neutral theory in two-dimensional forest ecosystems and here in dendritic riverine ecosystems suggests the possible application of neutral metacommunity models in a diverse suite of ecosystems. This framework offers direct linkage from large-scale forcing, such as global climate change, to biodiversity patterns.},

abstract = {Despite improvements in understanding biophysical response to climate change, a better understanding of how such changes will affect societies is still needed. We evaluated effects of climate change on the coupled human-environmental system of the McKenzie River watershed in the Oregon Cascades in order to assess its vulnerability. Published empirical and modeling results indicate that climate change will alter both the timing and quantity of streamflow, but understanding how these changes will impact different water users is essential to facilitate adaptation to changing conditions. In order to better understand the vulnerability of four water use sectors to changing streamflow, we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with representatives of each sector, in which we presented projected changes in streamflow and asked respondents to assess how changing water availability would impact their activities. In the McKenzie River watershed, there are distinct spatial and temporal patterns associated with sensitivity of water resources to climate change. This research illustrates that the implications of changing streamflow vary substantially among different water users, with vulnerabilities being determined in part by the spatial scale and timing of water use and the flexibility of those uses in time and space. Furthermore, institutions within some sectors were found to be better positioned to effectively respond to changes in water resources associated with climate change, while others have substantial barriers to the flexibility needed to manage for new conditions. A clearer understanding of these opportunities and constraints across water use sectors can provide a basis for improving response capacity and potentially reducing vulnerability to changing water resources in the region. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Fire regime characteristics of high-elevation forests on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, Arizona, were re- constructed from fire scar analysis, remote sensing, tree age, and forest structure measurements, a first attempt at detailed reconstruction of the transition from surface to stand-replacing fire patterns in the Southwest. Tree den- sities and fire-/non-fire-initiated groups were highly mixed over the landscape, so distinct fire-created stands could not be delineated from satellite imagery or the oldest available aerial photos. Surface fires were common from 1700 to 1879 in the 4,400 ha site, especially on S and W aspects. Fire dates frequently coincided with fire dates measured at study sites at lower elevation, suggesting that pre-1880 fire sizes may have been very large. Large fires, those scarring 25% or more of the sample trees, were relatively infrequent, averaging 31 years between burns. Four of the five major regional fire years occurred in the 1700s, followed by a 94-year gap until 1879. Fires typically occurred in significantly dry years (Palmer Drought Stress Index), with severe drought in major regional fire years. Currently the forest is predominantly spruce-fir, mixed conifer, and aspen. In contrast, den- droecological reconstruction of past forest structure showed that the forest in 1880 was very open, corresponding closely with historical (1910) accounts of severe fires leaving partially denuded landscapes. Age structure and species composition were used to classify sampling points into fire-initiated and non-fire-initiated groups. Tree groups on nearly 60% of the plots were fire-initiated; the oldest such groups appeared to have originated after severe fires in 1782 or 1785. In 1880, all fire-initiated groups were less than 100 years old and nearly 25% of the groups were less than 20 years old. Non-fire-initiated groups were significantly older (oldest 262 years in 1880), dominated by ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, or white fir, and occurred preferentially on S and W slopes. The mixed-severity fire regime, transitioning from lower-elevation surface fires to mixed surface and stand-replacing fire at higher elevations, appeared not to have been stable over the temporal and spatial scales of this study. Information about historical fire regime and forest structure is valuable for managers but the information is prob- ably less specific and stable for high-elevation forests than for low-elevation ponderosa pine forests.},

abstract = {In this paper, we use compromise programming to solve a multiple-objective land use and forest management planning model. Long- and short- ('fast') term carbon uptake, maintenance of structural diversity, and economic (net returns to forestry and agriculture) objectives are simultaneously achieved by minimizing the distance between current objective values and the ideal ones. Two distance metrics are used, representing a risk neutral and highly risk-averse decision maker. An application of the model to public forestland and adjacent private agricultural lands in the (boreal) Peace River region of northeastern British Columbia indicates that both short- and long-term carbon uptake, and maintenance of structural diversity, can be achieved only at the high financial costs. Contrary to earlier studies, we also find conflict between both short- and long-term carbon uptakes and maintenance of landscape structural diversity. Targeting short-term carbon uptake results in the greatest deviation from desired structural diversity, although the deviation is somewhat smaller with respect to the long-term carbon uptake goal. Further, risk neutral and risk-averse decision makers will employ significantly different land use and forest management strategies. Finally, the 'balanced' strategy (which underachieves attainment of the 'ideal' by the same degree for all objectives) attains diversity targets quite closely, but significantly underachieves economic and carbon objectives. Maximization of the weighted sum of objective deviations results in an 'average' strategy that performs much better in attaining carbon objectives, but diversity is sacrificed. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Expansion of Pinus and Juniperus species into shrub steppe in semi-arid regions of the western United States has been widely documented and attributed in part to fire exclusion. If decreased fire frequency has been an important cause of woodland expansion, one would expect to find age structures dominated by younger trees on more fire-prone sites, with old-growth pinyon-juniper woodland limited to sites with lower fire risk. We compared current oldgrowth distribution with spatial models for fire risk in a 19-km2 watershed in central Nevada, USA. Multiple GIS models were developed to represent fire susceptibility, according to abiotic factors representing fuels and topographic barriers to fire spread. We also developed cellular automata models to generate fire susceptibility surfaces that additionally account for neighborhood effects. Rule-based GIS models failed to predict old-growth distribution better than random models. Cellular automata models incorporating spatial heterogeneity of site productivity predicted old-growth distribution better than random models but with low accuracy, ranging from 58% agreement at the single-pixel (0.09-ha) scale to 80% agreement for 20-pixel neighborhoods. The best statistical model for predicting old-growth occurrence included the negative effect of topographic convergence index (local wetness), and the positive effects of solar insolation and proximity to rock outcrops. Results support the hypothesis that old-growth woodlands in the Great Basin are more likely to occur on sites with low fire risk. However, weak relationships suggest that old-growth woodlands have not been confined to fire-safe sites. Conservation efforts should consider the landscape context of old-growth woodlands across a broad landscape, with an emphasis on conserving landscape variability in tree age structure.},

abstract = {Recent, large fires in the western United States have rekindled debates about fire management and the role of natural fire regimes in the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems. This real-world experience parallels debates involving abstract models of forest fires, a central metaphor in complex systems theory. Both real and modeled fire-prone landscapes exhibit roughly power law statistics in fire size versus frequency. Here, we examine historical fire catalogs and a detailed fire simulation model; both are in agreement with a highly optimized tolerance model. Highly optimized tolerance suggests robustness tradeoffs underlie resilience in different fire-prone ecosystems. Understanding these mechanisms may provide new insights into the structure of ecological systems and be key in evaluating fire management strategies and sensitivities to climate change.},

@article{Stow1993,
abstract = {The major objective of the research reported in this paper was to perform a pilot study for mapping fire fuel properties of southern Californian chaparral shrubs and associated forest ecotones using multi-date (seasonal) Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image data. Information on past, current and future (predicted) distributions of vegetation properties pertaining to fire fuels are necessary for understanding, monitoring, managing and modeling fire in changing Mediterranean landscapes. Seasonal and interannual variability of some vegetation properties can be extracted from multi-date remotely sensed data that may provide useful information pertaining to fire fuel distributions. Brightness (BR), Greenness (GR) and Wetness (WT) transform images were derived from two geometrically and radiometrically registered TM images acquired in San Diego Country. California, USA, near the beginning and end of the 1986-1987 growing season. Seasonal difference images of these transforms were also generated. Transform and difference values were stratified by vegetation community type and stand age or slope aspect, using an existing raster geographic information system database. The BR and GR images provided unique spatial information pertaining to vegetation conditions. Seasonal change in BR was highest for burn and meadow areas, while high values in seasonal change in GR corresponded to deciduous oak woodlands, grasslands and vegetated north facing slopes. End-of-season GR for Mixed Chaparral varied with stand age in a manner which was similar to field measurements of total and live standing biomass. Differential illumination effects seem to dominate spatial variations in BR and GR values and their seasonal change as a function of slope aspect.},
annote = {This is a study that Kate Brandis and Carol Jacobson used to provide some information in their introduction. This is the plot study for fire fuel properties in Southern California chaparral forests. They state that chaparral forests have high recurrence intervals for fires and fires burn extremely hot. These pose severe threats to the communities around these forests. The study examined information content of Landsat data. Stow et al suggest that the need for this data is vital because the changing atmosphere and climate could cause changes in fire regimes.},

@article{Laird1982,
abstract = {Models for the analysis of longitudinal data must recognize the relationship between serial observations on the same unit. Multivariate models with general covariance structure are often difficult to apply to highly unbalanced data, whereas two-stage random-effects models can be used easily. In two-stage models, the probability distributions for the response vectors of different individuals belong to a single family, but some random-effects parameters vary across individuals, with a distribution specified at the second stage. A general family of models is discussed, which includes both growth models and repeated-measures models as special cases. A unified approach to fitting these models, based on a combination of empirical Bayes and maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and using the EM algorithm, is discussed. Two examples are taken from a current epidemiological study of the health effects of air pollution.},

@article{Beale2010,
abstract = {Many of the most interesting questions ecologists ask lead to analyses of spatial data. Yet, perhaps confused by the large number of statistical models and fitting methods available, many ecologists seem to believe this is best left to specialists. Here, we describe the issues that need consideration when analysing spatial data and illustrate these using simulation studies. Our comparative analysis involves using methods including generalized least squares, spatial filters, wavelet revised models, conditional autoregressive models and generalized additive mixed models to estimate regression coefficients from synthetic but realistic data sets, including some which violate standard regression assumptions. We assess the performance of each method using two measures and using statistical error rates for model selection. Methods that performed well included generalized least squares family of models and a Bayesian implementation of the conditional auto-regressive model. Ordinary least squares also performed adequately in the absence of model selection, but had poorly controlled Type I error rates and so did not show the improvements in performance under model selection when using the above methods. Removing large-scale spatial trends in the response led to poor performance. These are empirical results; hence extrapolation of these findings to other situations should be performed cautiously. Nevertheless, our simulation-based approach provides much stronger evidence for comparative analysis than assessments based on single or small numbers of data sets, and should be considered a necessary foundation for statements of this type in future.},
